		<h2>Slavery Comes to the New World</h2>
		
		<p>After the discovery of the American continent at the end of the 15th century, opportunities for expansion and enrichment arose for European countries. Abundant resources were within reach and would belong to those who could develop the new territories the most rapidly.</p>
		
		<p>Building colonies and exploiting the land demanded a large workforce, however, which would have been very expensive for colonizers. But what if the labourers worked for free?</p>

			<p>When Christian European crusaders conquered North Africa and the Eastern Mediterranean during the 11th and 12th centuries, they were introduced to the practice of sugar production, an industry that was well established in the Arab world.</p>
			
			<p>After being defeated by the Muslims and expelled from these regions, Europeans established sugar plantations in their Mediterranean territories: southern Spain and Portugal, Sicily, and Cyprus.</p>
	
			<p>Sugar production demands a large labour force. Bound workers were the preferred solution, due to the low cost and the refusal of the local residents to work on sugar estates. Sugar planters imported African slaves from the trans-Saharan trade, but also European and Arab war captives from the Black Sea (a result of the holy wars).</p>
	
			<p>There were few slaves in the Mediterranean trade because of the low demand for sugar in 13th-century Europe, but when better sugar extraction techniques were developed and large territories became available through colonization, the plantations soon spread and the need for slaves increased. Workers were sent first to the Spanish- and Portuguese-controlled islands off the coast of West Africa (Canaries, Cape Verde . . . ) and later to the colonies of the New World, initiating the transatlantic slave trade.</p>

			<p>The advancement of sailing technology during the 15th century enabled Europeans to trade directly with West Africans and spread their commercial network across the Atlantic to the New World.</p>
			
			<p>Based on the sugar production model they had established in the Mediterranean, the Spanish and the Portuguese started plantations in their colonies in South America and the Caribbean. Gold and silver mining also became lucrative activities.</p>
				
			<p>Sugar planting and mining require extensive manual labour. At first, natives were used, but their numbers decreased dramatically due to overwork and epidemics of European diseases (such as smallpox). The need for a labour force made the Europeans turn to West Africa for slave importation. In 1502, the Spanish started bringing African slaves to the New World to work on their plantations.</p>
	
			<p>The competition between European countries to develop the New World became fierce. The Portuguese first dominated West African trade, but their colonies and trading bases were soon raided by the Spanish, the British, the French, and the Dutch during the 16th and 17th centuries.</p>

			<p>All those countries needed workers in their developing colonies: between 1701 and 1810 alone, 7,440,000 slaves entered the Americas. To secure sources of captives, Europeans made deals with African officials and raided villages as well.</p>
	
			<p>Between the 15th and 19th centuries, more than 11 million African slaves in total were brought to the New World, and millions more died during their transport and "storage" in Africa or on slave ships crossing the Atlantic Ocean.</p>

			<p>The Treaty of Tordesillas (named after the Spanish city where it was signed in 1494) was an initiative of Pope Alexander VI to settle the differences between Portugal and Spain regarding newly discovered lands in the Atlantic and the New World.</p>
			
			<p>A north-south line of demarcation was drawn halfway between the Portuguese Cape Verde Islands and the islands discovered by Christopher Columbus in America (Cuba and Hispaniola). Portugal gained control on the east side of the line (Atlantic Ocean Islands except the Canaries and West Africa), and Spain received all the territories on the west side (all the New World except Brazil).</p>
			
			<p>The Treaty of Tordesillas was not strictly enforced. It was eventually nullified by new circumstances (Portugal and Spain shared the same king for several years) and later conflicts between the two countries.</p>

			<p>During the transatlantic slave trade, African slaves were mostly war captives, victims of the numerous tribal conflicts in West and Central Africa. The defeated combatants and their villages would be captured inland, chained together, and walked to the coast, going from one indigenous trader to another. Many prisoners died during the journey, and many tried to escape, but few succeeded.</p>
			
			<p>On the coast, the men, women, and children were kept in "factories," large holding areas built for that purpose. They could spend months in that unsanitary environment until a sufficient number of people was gathered for a shipment. European traders then came to make their selection. The traders examined the captives and paid the African middlemen. The slaves were marked with a hot iron to confirm they belonged to one of the European trading companies.</p>

			<p>On the slave ships, up to 400 prisoners were tightly packed on decks with less than five feet of headroom, naked and chained together. For two months, they lived confined in a hot and humid environment, lying down in human excrement, with barely enough provisions to survive. In these conditions, at least 10–20% of the cargo died of various diseases during the journey. Suicide was rarely an option: captives who tried to starve themselves were force-fed (a live slave being more valuable than a dead one), and they had little chance to throw themselves overboard.</p>
	
			<p>The slaves who made it alive to the Americas underwent legal inspections on the ships and more physical examinations by the local merchants before being transferred to warehouses and camps. There, they were fed, cleaned up, and given medical attention while waiting to be sold.</p>
