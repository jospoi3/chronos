		<h2>The Birth of Traditions</h2>
			
			<p>The initiatives taken by African American artists and intellectuals during the New Negro Renaissance generated an atmosphere that facilitated the emergence of African American academic literature and the African American short story tradition, with Charles W. Chesnutt as a pioneer of the genre. Frederick Douglass' last autobiography is also published during this period.</p>

			<p class="citation">Mr. Ryder might aptly be called the dean of the Blue Veins. The original Blue Veins were a little society of colored persons organized in a certain Northern city shortly after the war. Its purpose was to establish and maintain correct social standards among a people whose social condition presented almost unlimited room for improvement. By accident, combined perhaps with some natural affinity, the society consisted of individuals who were, generally speaking, more white than black. Some envious outsider made the suggestion that no one was eligible for membership who was not white enough to show blue veins. The suggestion was readily adopted by those who were not of the favored few, and since that time the society, though possessing a longer and more pretentious name, had been known far and wide as the "Blue Vein Society," and its members as the "Blue Veins."<br />

			<p>At the peak of his literary career, from 1899 to 1905, Charles W. Chesnutt witnessed the regression of African American status in the South after the Reconstruction Period and the rise of prejudice, according to which blacks were incapable of assuming citizenship reponsibilities.</p>
			
			<p>In the two short story collections and three novels he published during that period, Chesnutt not only depicted the psychological effects of slavery and racism on African Americans, he also demonstrated how their strength and dignity made them entitled to the same rights as white Americans.</p>
	
			<p>Today, specialists recognize Charles W. Chesnutt as the most influential African American fiction writer of his time and the founder of the short story tradition in African American literature.</p>
	
			<p>His writings include:</p>

				I was born in Tuckahoe, near Hillsborough, and about twelve miles from Easton, in Talbot county, Maryland. I have no accurate knowledge of my age, never having seen any authentic record containing it. By far the larger part of the slaves know as little of their ages as horses know of theirs, and it is the wish of most masters within my knowledge to keep their slaves thus ignorant. I do not remember to have ever met a slave who could tell of his birthday. They seldom come nearer to it than planting-time, harvesttime, cherry-time, spring-time, or fall-time. A want of information concerning my own was a source of unhappiness to me even during childhood. The white children could tell their ages. I could not tell why I ought to be deprived of the same privilege. I was not allowed to make any inquiries of my master concerning it. He deemed all such inquiries on the part of a slave improper and impertinent, and evidence of a restless spirit. The nearest estimate I can give makes me now between twenty-seven and twenty-eight years of age. I come to this, from hearing my master say, some time during 1835, I was about seventeen years old.<br />

		</div><!--/.content-image-container-->
		
		<div class="content-text-container right">
		
			<p>Charles Waddell Chesnutt was born in Cleveland, Ohio, on June 20, 1858. His parents were two free African Americans from the South, but his mixed heritage allowed him to easily pass as white. Chesnutt never denied his African American roots, although racial passing (the assimilation of a mixed-race person to the white majority) was a common phenomenon at the time.</p>
			
			<p>The Chesnutts moved back to the South, to North Carolina, where Charles grew up during the Reconstruction Period. He attended school in a Freedmen's Bureau institution, and later became a teacher and then an assistant principal. A studious young man, he learned several languages and stenography.  Tired of the restrictions on blacks in the South and hoping to enter the literary world, Chesnutt moved north with his wife in his early twenties. He settled in Cleveland, where he passed the Ohio State bar and opened a successful court reporting business. He also began to publish short stories, mostly folk tales, in various newspapers and magazines. Because Chesnutt's works were in line with the latest literary trend (realism), his African American heritage did not prevent him from being published. In fact, in 1887, he became the first African American to publish in the Atlantic Monthly, a prestigious literary and cultural magazine.</p>
	
			<p>A decade later, in 1899, Chesnutt published two collections of short stories and a biography of Frederick Douglass. His tales of slaves outwitting their masters mixed realism and fantasy, and used African American folklore and dialect to address social issues such as slavery, segregation, and prejudice. Chesnutt's works were an enormous success and allowed him to start writing full time. With these publications, Chesnutt became "the first African American writer of fiction to enlist the white-controlled publishing industry in the service of his social message" (Gates and McKay 602).</p>
	
			<p>In his writings, Chesnutt wanted to bring to light the social and psychological effects of discrimination and abuse on African Americans, and the qualities blacks developed to counter these, such as strong character and imagination.  In this way, he wished to demonstrate that African Americans deserved full citizenship. The works of Chesnutt explored all aspects of black culture in America, from fantastic folk tales to realistic fiction stories about issues such as race riots, interracial unions, and racial passing.</p>
			
			<p>Like those of his contemporaries Booker T. Washington and W.E.B. DuBois, Chesnutt's point of view on the situation of blacks in the United States stirred up debates. Writing about a wide range of African American issues including disturbing topics such as interracial unions and racial passing was seen by certain critics as exemplary literary realism, but others found it deeply shocking. Some also thought that the portrayal of the slaves in his folk tales and the use of dialect supported black stereotypes.</p>
			
			<p>The controversy surrounding Chesnutt's works contributed to the decline of his success. To provide a constant standard of living for his family, he decided to reopen his stenography business. Nevertheless, he continued publishing stories in magazines and writing books until his death in 1932, but his literary contribution was eclipsed by the writers of the Harlem Renaissance, who saw him as old-fashioned. Some of his novels were published more than 60 years after his death, after the value of his work was reassessed in the late 20th century.</p>
			
			<p>Despite  all this, Charles Chesnutt's legacy is considerable. He was the first African American writer to consider all racial issues faced by blacks in the United States and the most influential writer of fiction of his time. In addition to writing, he worked with Booker T. Washington for the political and social advancement of African Americans. He was awarded the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People's Spingarn Medal in 1928 for his work as an educator and writer.</p>

			<p>Anna Julia Haywood was born a slave in Raleigh, North Carolina, in 1858. Her mother, Hannah, was a slave in the home of an important landowner, who is believed by many historians to be Anna Julia's biological father.</p>
			
			<p>At nine years old, she received a scholarship to attend the St. Augustine's Normal School and Collegiate Institute for newly emancipated slaves. There she completed her schooling and later joined the faculty. In 1877, she married George Cooper, a professor of Greek at the school and also a former slave. After the death of her husband two years later, she never remarried.</p>
	
			<p>She enrolled at Oberlin College in 1881 and took the “Gentleman's Course,” rather than the program designed for women. She received her bachelor's degree in 1884, and after teaching for a few years at Wilberforce College and St. Augustine's, she went back to Oberlin to earn her master's degree in mathematics in 1887.</p>
	
			<p>That same year, Cooper was hired as a teacher of math and science at the Washington Colored High School in Washington, DC, also known as the M Street School, an elite public institution renowned for educating many African American leaders. She became principal of the school in 1902.</p>
			
			<p>Over the course of her long and sometimes difficult tenure, Cooper was very active politically in the struggle for both race and gender equality. She helped found the Colored Women's League of Washington, DC, in 1892. The same year, she published A Voice from the South, her most famous work and a major feminist text, in which she advocates racial justice and equal rights for African American women. At the Chicago World's Fair in 1893, she was one of the few African American women to address the World's Congress of Representative Women. She was one of the few women invited to participate in the first Pan-African Conference in London in 1900, organized by W. E. B. Du Bois and others. She helped edit The Southland magazine and contributed to the founding of the Colored Women's YWCA in 1905. During those years of teaching and social activism, Cooper also adopted and raised five orphaned children.</p>
			
			<p>During the 1910s, while working full-time, Cooper pursued doctoral studies at Columbia University and at the Sorbonne in Paris, France. She earned her doctorate from the University of Paris in 1925 at the age of 67, becoming one of the first African American women to receive a Ph.D. In her various publications, Dr. Cooper argued that black women were in the best position to reflect on social injustice and propose solutions, as they were discriminated against as both women and African Americans. In her eyes, the education of black women was essential to the development of the black community and to the progress of American society and the world.</p>
			
			<p>Dr. Cooper retired from M Street School in 1930 and became president of Frelinghuysen University, a night school for working black residents of Washington, DC. A dedicated educator, she believed in the power of instruction "to change lives individually and collectively" (Ammonsn. n. pag.). When necessary, she held classes in her home and remained with the institution until 1950.</p>
			
			<p>Anna Julia Cooper was one of the most well respected black intellectuals and educators of her time. As Mark S. Giles mentions in his biographical article, "Cooper's insightful and critical analysis of race, gender, and socioeconomic class dynamics established a cornerstone for the contemporary theories on black feminism (womanism) and the role of education in the uplift of the black community" (1). She died in her sleep at the age of 105 in Washington, DC, on February 27, 1964.</p>

			<p>William Edward Burghardt Du Bois was born February 23, 1868, in Great Barrington, a small, northern black community in Massachusetts. His father left his family soon after the birth of his son, but William's mother and her extended family cared for him and encouraged him to read and excel in school. He attended predominantly white institutions and later claimed he never felt any discrimination on the part of the white students (Gates and McKay 686).</p>
			
			<p>W. E. B. Du Bois truly discovered racism and African American life when he moved south, to Nashville, Tennessee, to study at Fisk University. He earned his bachelor's degree in 1888 and continued his studies at Harvard University, where he received a second undergraduate degree and a master's degree. After studying in Berlin for several years, Du Bois earned a doctorate in history from Harvard in 1895, with a dissertation on "The Suppression of the African Slave-Trade to the United States." After facing many disappointments while looking for work, Du Bois became a professor of history and economics at Atlanta University in 1897. His annual reports and conferences on the black population's way of life established the basis of African American sociology in the United States.</p>
	
			<p>After a few years, however, Du Bois became disillusioned with race relations in the South and realized that his academic research was doing little to change the living conditions of African Americans. He started publishing poetry and prose pieces to express his conviction that the values and culture of African Americans ought to be recognized and respected by all Americans, black and white alike.</p>
	
			<p>Du Bois's most renowned work, the 1903 essay collection titled The Souls of Black Folk, sums up his vision. The book, "brilliantly written and extraordinarily rich and complex as a portrait of black life" (Rampersad), stirred much controversy because it specifically attacked the political program of  Booker T. Washington, the most influential black American of the time.  Washington felt that African Americans should develop technical skills above all else, while Du Bois believed "it was vital for blacks to cultivate their own aesthetic and cultural values even as they made valuable strides toward social emancipation" ("William"). The Souls of Black Folk propelled Du Bois to the front of the African American civil rights scene and became a must-have for many young black artists and scholars.</p>
			
			<p>Du Bois finally gave up his position at Atlanta University in 1910 and moved to New York to become the Publications Director of the new National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) and the editor of its magazine, The Crisis. At the same time, he embraced socialism and was even a member of the Socialist party until 1912.</p>
			
			<p>In the decade that followed, Du Bois made The Crisis a vehicle for black writers and a stepping stone for the emerging artistic renaissance. He especially encouraged black female authors and artists, and even helped some of them financially. In fact, Du Bois was one of the first civil rights leaders to support the women's rights movement and one of the first writers to feature women as prominently as men in many of his novels.</p>
			
			<p>The Crisis was also a forum for Du Bois's ideas on the racial and political situation in America. In various articles and works he published at the time, Du Bois created controversy by promoting socialist ideas and urging young black writers to accept their political responsibilities. Apart from his involvement in The Crisis and the NAACP, Du Bois was also involved in the Pan-African movement. He organized a series of Pan-African congresses around the world in 1919, 1921, 1923, and 1927, with intellectuals from Africa, the West Indies, and the United States.</p>
			
			<p>The Great Depression of the 1930s increased Du Bois's support for a new socio-economic system and his interest in communism. In 1934, he resigned from the NAACP and The Crisis because of his new support for the Black Nationalist strategy, which opposed the NAACP's commitment to integration. He returned to Atlanta University, where he became chairman of the sociology department. In the following years, he published many historical volumes, including Black Reconstruction in America, 1860–1880, one of the best sources on the topic.</p>
			
			<p>Du Bois was forced to retire from the university in 1944, mostly because of his involvement in left-wing politics.  He returned to the NAACP as director of special research, only to be fired in 1948 for the same reason. Cast by the federal government as a subversive agent of a foreign power in 1951 (and acquitted a few months later), Du Bois was ostracized by many African American leaders and organizations.</p>
			
			<p>In 1961, he emigrated to Ghana in order to work on an Encyclopedia Africana, an almost lifelong interest. In 1963, he renounced his US citizenship and became a citizen of Ghana. He died in Accra on August 27,1963, one day before the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom.</p>
			
			<p>Despite the controversies,  W.E.B. Du Bois is widely acknowledged as the founder of the black  intelligentsia in the United States and as "the Renaissance man of African American letters" (Gates and McKay 686). His work on the sociology and history of African Americans is considered to be the foundation of Black Studies programs in American universities. A multi-talented and prolific writer, he influenced generations of black artists and intellectuals, and dedicated his life to the struggle for the equality of all people.</p>

			<p>Frederick Augustus Washington Bailey was born a slave near Hillsboro in Maryland in February 1818. His mother was a slave, and his father an unknown white man. Frederick never knew his exact date of birth or the identity of his father (who many suspect to have been his first master, Aaron Anthony). He spent his early childhood with his grandparents and an aunt. He saw his mother only a few times before her death when he was seven years old.</p>
			
			<p>A year later, in 1826, Frederick was sent to Baltimore to serve Hugh and Sophia Auld. Sophia started teaching young Frederick how to read, but when her husband found out, he angrily put a stop to the lessons. From that moment, as an act of rebellion, Frederick taught himself how to read and write. In 1833, he was returned to his legal owner in Maryland, who sent him to a farm held by a renowned slavebreaker, Edward Covey. After months of mistreatment and humiliation, Frederick fought back and won. He was never beaten again. This event was a turning point in Frederick's history and future writings.</p>
	
			<p>In 1836, Frederick returned to Baltimore and started investing his earnings in an escape plan. He succeeded in 1838.  With the help of his future wife and false papers in hand, he took a train, pretending to be a free black sailor. He arrived a month later with his bride in the black community of New Bedford, Massachussetts, where he took on a new name: Frederick Douglass.</p>
	
			<p>Douglass joined the abolitionist movement and became a renowned speaker. Because of rumours that such an articulate man could hardly have been born a slave, Douglass wrote his first autobiography in 1845, titled Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, an American Slave, Written by Himself. The book was an international bestseller. Afraid that the information might endanger his freedom, Douglass departed on a lecture tour for England, Scotland, and Ireland. Two years later, he purchased his emancipation with the help of friends and returned to the United States. In 1847, he founded the North Star, a black-run newspaper promoting a stronger role for African Americans in the fight against slavery.</p>
			
			<p>In the 1850s, Douglass changed his earlier belief that the Constitution encouraged slavery. He came to agree that, instead, the document should be used to fight for the emancipation of African Americans. This reversal of opinion distanced Douglass from the radical branch of the abolitionist movement and made him reconsider his goals. In 1855, he published a second autobiography, My Bondage and My Freedom, in which he discussed his transition to freedom and reflected on slavery, racism, and the complexity of American society.</p>
			
			<p>During the Civil War, Douglass conferred with Abraham Lincoln and campaigned for letting blacks engage in the fight for their freedom. He actively participated in the recruitment of African Americans in the Union Army.</p>
	
			<p>After the war, Douglass was given important political positions. He also continued speaking around the country, promoting voting rights, racial equality, and women's rights. These activities allowed him and his family to live comfortably in Washington for the rest of his life.</p>
	
			<p>In 1892, Douglass published his last autobiography: Life and Times of Frederick Douglass. He died suddenly three years later, in 1895, shortly after giving a speech at a women's rights meeting.</p>

			<p>Booker Taliaferro Washington was born a slave in 1856 in Hale's Ford, Virginia. His mother was a black slave, and his father an unknown white man. As a child, Washington worked as a house slave and accompanied his master's children to school, to carry their books. This peek at a classroom left him fascinated by education.</p>
			
			<p>When slavery was abolished in 1865, Washington's family moved to Malden, West Virginia. At nine years old, Booker T. Washington started working in salt and coal mines. He began early in the morning in order to attend school in the afternoon. At the age of 16, disappointed by the quality of schooling in his area, he obtained permission from his parents to quit work and return to Virginia to attend the Hampton Institute, an industrial school for blacks and native Americans founded after the Civil War. Washington made the trip on foot and paid his tuition and board at the institute by working as the janitor.</p>
	
			<p>Because Washington believed that education was the key to equality in his country, he became a teacher after graduation. After first teaching at the Hampton Institute,  he was recommended for a principal position at the new Tuskegee Normal and Industrial Institute in Alabama, in 1881. The need to raise funds for the institute and other educational programs led Washington to travel all over the United States. He soon became a well-known speaker for the improvement of black education.</p>
	
			<p>In 1895, Washington—who over the years had emerged as a famous educator and orator—was invited to pronounce the opening speech at the Cotton States Exposition, an unprecedented honour for an African American. His address, known as the "Atlanta Compromise," explained his major thesis, that blacks could secure their constitutional rights through their own economic and moral advancement rather than through legal and political changes. He asserted that blacks and whites could remain separate in social matters, but that in economic matters there should not be any barriers to advancement. Through hard work, African Americans would achieve self-reliance and economic success, and prove they deserved fair treatment before the law.</p>
			
			<p>Washington's autobiography Up From Slavery, published in 1901, conveyed a similar message in an attempt to reconcile blacks and whites. Education and economic self-sufficiency took precedence over civil and political rights. Social solidarity between African Americans would help them cope with segregation. Washington condemned slavery, but he believed that African Americans had gained valuable skills, confidence, and strength in their struggle with bondage.</p>
			
			<p>This point of view stirred up controversy at the time. His conciliatory stand angered many blacks, especially educated professionals, who feared it would be harmful to their demands for political and civil rights. On the other hand, it won over many southern whites (some former slaveowners), without whose financial support Washington could not have achieved his educational projects, including turning the Tuskegee Institute into a significant institution.</p>
			
			<p>Booker T. Washington's legacy as a black leader and educator is substantial. The Tuskegee Institute became the Tuskegee University, which today is one of the best colleges in the United States and enrols approximately 3,000 students of all origins. After Washington's death in 1915, it was discovered that he had secretly been involved in anti-segregationist activities, such as projects to fight lynching, disenfranchisement, and unequal facilities in education and transportation. He also challenged many state laws in court with his attorneys and financially supported blacks who could not afford legal services.</p>

			<p>In 1832, the white minstrel performer Thomas "Daddy" Rice created a caricature of African Americans, inspired by a man he had seen while travelling in the South. With a blackened face, Rice would dance in a ridiculous way while singing a song called  "Jump Jim Crow." The stereotypical character later became a common part of the show scene in the United States.  </p>
			
			<p>By the end of the 19th century, the image of Jim Crow was so strong it began to be applied to the segregation laws and attitudes that discriminated against African Americans. Under Jim Crow, blacks attended separate schools and colleges, and were subject to segregation at work and in public places. In stores, they were served after white customers and required to talk only when spoken to. No terms of respect were used with them; they were called "boy," "girl," "uncle," "auntie," and often "nigger."</p>
	
			<p>To survive Jim Crow at the time, especially in the South, African Americans often preferred to avoid whites and concentrate on developing their autonomy and independence. Resistance fully began in the 1920s, with legal actions by civil rights organizations such as the NAACP and the emergence of a unique black culture during the Harlem Renaissance. After the numerous civil rights battles of the 1950s and 1960s, the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 finally ended Jim Crow by eliminating the legal disenfranchisement and segregation of African Americans.</p>
	
			<p>Today, because so few people know the meaning of the expression, it could be said that Jim Crow has disappeared, but recurrent cases of inequality and racial discrimination in education and jobs demonstrate that the spirit of Jim Crow is not yet gone.</p>

			<p>The Jim Crow laws and customs were based on the deep-rooted belief that African Americans were an inferior people. Since the 1620s, to justify slavery, especially when abolitionist movements started in the northern states, white slave owners had clung to the racist idea that blacks were unintelligent and lazy.</p>

			<p>The emergence of the minstrel shows in the 1840s strongly embedded stereotypical representations of black Americans in the popular culture. They featured white comedians in blackface and sometimes black comedians in silly comic routines that ridiculed African Americans and their culture. Many black artists' genuine talent for comedy sadly supported the racist views of blacks as incompetent and stupid people.</p>

			<p>The idea quickly spread to the vaudeville theatre, the sheet music industry, as well as the film and radio businesses and commercial advertising. Representations of impoverished blacks with ink-black skin, thick red lips, and bulging eyeballs appeared almost everywhere.</p>
				
			<p>A racist literary tradition also supported those beliefs.  Authors like Joel Chandler Harris and Thomas Nelson portrayed the days of slavery as a time of racial harmony in which faithful and ignorant plantation slaves lived a life of mutual affection and respect with their masters.  Others, like Thomas Dixon, depicted emancipated blacks as criminals and cultivated white fear of African Americans.</p>

			</div>
						
			<p>On radio sketches and in Hollywood films, blacks were generally presented either as faithful and pathetic servants or as silly chicken stealers. Many classic American films like Birth of a Nation (1915) or Gone with the Wind (1939) featured such stereotypes. Birth of a Nation also strengthened the image of black men as beasts who lusted after innocent white women.</p>
						
			<p>These portrayals of African Americans as unintelligent, lazy, conniving, and dangerous dominated the media during the Jim Crow era. They justified a discriminatory society in which lynching, the Ku Klux Klan, disfranchisement, and segregation were acceptable.</p>

			<p>Significant contrasts also emerged, however: in the 1920s, the Harlem Renaissance movement and the arrival of "race movies" featuring all-black casts playing rich and complex characters proved the value of African Americans and their culture.</p>

			<p>World War I had a major impact on African Americans. A growing number of blacks from the South had been moving to northern cities since 1877, but as European countries increased their demand for American products while preparing for war, the need for workers in the factories of the North augmented. This situation allowed blacks to finally enter the industrial sector. They were hired by railroads, meatpacking businesses, and stockyards, and they replaced white workers who left service jobs for factory jobs.</p>
			
			<p>When the United States became involved in the war in April 1917, African Americans set aside their demands and joined white Americans in the fight for democracy. Fearing that a German victory would kill black aspirations for equality, most African American leaders encouraged their fellow citizens to participate in the war effort. As a result, approximately two million African Americans applied for the draft.</p>
	
			<p>As they were in civil society, African Americans were discriminated against in the military. During the draft, they were denied exemptions granted to whites. With 370,000 men serving in the armed forces, African Americans made up almost 13% of all draftees, although they represented only 10% of the population. In the army, blacks were not admitted to the Marines, the Coast Guard, or the Air Force, and they were generally kept away from combat units, mostly working as labourers in service units.</p>
	
			<p>At home, African American soldiers faced a hostile attitude from whites and were often the victims of violent racial incidents. It was one of these incidents that forced the War Department to send the first all-black combat unit overseas in December 1917: the 369th Infantry Regiment from New York. The regiment had been formed before the war, in 1913, sponsored by the Union League Club of New York.</p>
			
			<p>Because there was no official role for African American soldiers in Europe, the 369th was assigned to the French army, along with other American regiments. After 191 days at the front, one of the longest assignments given in the war, almost one-third of the 369th regiment had died in combat, but the unit had given no ground and no men had been captured. Acknowledging this remarkable achievement, the Germans nicknamed the regiment "Hellfighters," and the French government awarded all its members the Croix de Guerre. One hundred and seventy-one men received individual citations for bravery, an astounding record. In addition to their military exploits, the "Harlem Hellfighters" left their cultural mark; the regiment's band introduced the first samples of jazz music to Europe.</p>
			
			<p>After the war, despite the participation and sacrifice of black Americans in the conflict, it became clear that the majority of the white population had no intention of treating them differently from before. African Americans continued to face discrimination everywhere, including in the military.</p>

			<p>On August 14 and 15, 1908, in Springfield, Illinois, a mob of white citizens, enraged by the transfer of two black prisoners from the city jail, burned houses and businesses owned by African Americans. Seven people were killed during the riot (blacks and whites), and many others wounded.</p>
			
			<p>The event sent shock waves through the United States and highlighted the urgent need to address the racial issue in the country. The riot served as a catalyst for the creation of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). This non-profit organization was founded on February 12, 1909, by a multiracial group of activists including W.E.B. Du Bois, Ida B.

			<p>Its mission was "to ensure the political, educational, social, and economic equality of minority group citizens of the United States and eliminate race prejudice" (The NAACP n. pag.).</p>
	
			<p>Since its beginnings, the NAACP has taken legal and social action against Jim Crow policies and segregation. Its most famous cases include the 1954 lawsuit Brown v. Board of Education (which declared state-sponsored segregation of schools unconstitutional) and the public transportation boycott in Alabama in 1955–1956. The NAACP's legal branch (today an independent organization) defended and counselled Martin Luther King, Jr., in the 1960s protests.</p>
			
			<p>Today, the NAACP focuses on "disparities in economics, health care, education, voter empowerment, and the criminal justice system, while also continuing its role as legal advocate for civil rights issues" (The NAACP n. pag.). Its recent actions involve preventing youths from joining street gangs and regulating credit card interest rates and house loans.</p>
			
			<p>The NAACP is now the largest civil rights organization in the United States, with more than 300,000 members of all origins.</p>

			<p>After the rights of African Americans drastically shrank back following the Reconstruction Period, a new generation of black activists emerged. As the context of World War I revealed rampant discrimination in US industries and the American armed forces, in addition to general violence and oppression, the "New Negroes" fought for equality in the political, social, and cultural spheres. The rise of a black working class and an educated African American population breathed new life into the various movements that appeared at that time.</p>
			
			<p>As growing organizations promoted civil rights (such as the NAACP) as well as racial pride and solidarity (such as Marcus Garvey's UNIA), black culture also underwent a significant development. The need for books in African American schools, as well as the desire to inspire black Americans and instruct white Americans, encouraged many black scholars to become authors. They wrote essays, black history studies, and biographies, but also poetry, songs, and popular fiction.</p>
	
			<p>Finding a publisher was almost impossible for African American writers. Very few were famous enough (like Booker T. Washington or Frederick Douglass) or trendy enough (like Charles W. Chesnutt) to be acknowledged by white publishing houses. In fact, most African American writings of that era were distributed to a black audience by the African American Press, a coalition of people and organizations that published dozens of books, newspapers, and magazines on issues that affected the black population. The Crisis, managed by the NAACP, and Negro World, managed by the UNIA, are examples of publications geared toward the black population at the time.</p>
	
			<p>This abundance of information allowed African Americans to become more self-aware, and to develop pride in their history and culture. By challenging racist trends and promoting positive and forward thinking, the "New Negroes" set the stage for the next cultural revolution that would transfigure African American literature, music, and art: the Harlem Renaissance.</p>

			<p>In 1877, the return to power of the Democratic Party and the removal of the federal troops from the southern states ended the Reconstruction Period. The former slave states wasted little time reversing most of the laws that had protected African Americans. Jim Crow policies were adopted, and white supremacy groups like the Ku Klux Klan increased their violent repression measures, with little opposition from the federal government. </p>
			
			<p>As a consequence, an estimated 1.5 million African Americans from the South moved to northern and western cities such as New York, Chicago, St. Louis, and Cleveland (Mintz n. pag.). The primary factor for migration was the racial climate and widespread violence in the South. In addition to Jim Crow laws and lynching, major floods and insect infestations convinced many African American farmers to leave.</p>
	
			<p>In northern states, the black population could receive a better education, and black men could vote (women joined them in 1920). There was no government assistance for the newcomers, but industries such as the railroads, meat packers, and stockyards recruited African Americans. World War I and restrictions on immigration created additional employment opportunities.</p>
	
			<p>One consequence of the Great Migration to northern cities was the adoption of residential segregation policies to keep blacks out of white neighbourhoods. These municipal ordinances were declared unconstitutional in 1917 by the Supreme Court, but many white neighbourhoods resorted to formal deed restrictions to prevent property owners from selling to blacks. This practice lasted until 1948, when it was outlawed by the Supreme Court.</p>
			
			<p>Confinement to all-black areas led to the development of African American inner cities in the 1920s. Harlem, in New York, was the largest of them all, with 200,000 African American residents. Like other inner cities, Harlem was at grips with the problems of poverty, crime, unemployment, and so on. But its numerous population also made it an epicentre of the American black culture and the heart of a major cultural movement: the Harlem Renaissance.</p>
