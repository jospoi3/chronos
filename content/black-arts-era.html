		<h2>The Power of Words</h2>
			
			<p>During the Black Arts Era, African Americans were encouraged to assert themselves and claim their rights. Their empowerment and their ongoing struggles were reflected in different forms of artistic expression, such as speeches, poetry, and music.</p>

			<p class="citation">Yesterday I spoke in London, and both ways on the plane across the Atlantic I was studying a document about how the United Nations proposes to insure the human rights of the oppressed minorities of the world. The American black man is the world's most shameful case of minority oppression. What makes the black man think of himself as only an internal United States issue is just a catch-phrase, two words, "civil rights." How is the black man going to get "civil rights" before first he wins his human rights, and then start thinking of himself as part of one of the world's great peoples, he will see he has a case for the United Nations.<br />
<br />
I can't think of a better case! Four hundred years of black blood and sweat invested here in America, and the white man still has the black man begging for what every immigrant fresh off the ship can take for granted the minute he walks down the gangplank.<br />

			<p>The Autobiography of Malcolm X, written with Alex Haley, is certainly Malcolm X's most renowned work. It became a bestseller the year it came out, and Time magazine included it in its list of ten required nonfiction readings of the 20th century. The book was an international success and is extensively studied as a "classic American autobiography" (Norton 2004). It also inspired the award-winning movie Malcolm X, directed by Spike Lee.</p>
			
			<p>Malcolm X was famous for his oratorical skills. Since his assassination in 1965, several collections of his speeches and communications have been released.</p>

			<p>Unlike housing, employment, and education, music did not require massive demonstrations or legal battles to end discrimination. The catchy rhythms of R&B and soul music easily conquered black and white audiences across America and around the world.</p>
			
			<p class="works">R&B</p>
	
			<p>In 1949, Billboard magazine changed the name of its African American music chart from "Race Records" to the less offensive "Rhythm and Blues." The latter referred to an "urbane, rocking, jazz-based music with a heavy, insistent beat" (Palmer 146) that was becoming more and more popular, with hits on both black and white music charts. Rhythm and blues (R&B)  shared many characteristics with previous African American music genres, such as call and response patterns; repetition of musical notes, rhythms, phrases, or verses; and the use of "blue notes." The increase in the popularity of this African American musical genre in the 1950s was accompanied by the emergence of black radio stations, black disc-jockeys, and independent record companies that helped spread R&B music to wider audiences.</p>
	
			<p class="works">Soul Music</p>
			
			<p>As R&B's popularity increased all over the United States, it developed into new genres in the late 1950s. While rock n' roll quickly became the favourite of white audiences and performers, soul music became the new voice of African Americans. Soul music originated in the southern United States; a combination of R&B and gospel, it puts greater emphasis on vocalists and musical arrangements and merges spiritual and worldly themes. Sam Cooke, Ray Charles, and James Brown are commonly considered to be the creators of soul music.</p>
			
			<p>In the late 1960s, inspired by the Black Power Movement, many soul artists communicated empowerment messages to African Americans in their works. Songs like Aretha Franklin’s "Respect" and James Brown's "Say It Loud—I'm Black and I'm Proud" called for black pride and equal rights. The high rankings of these productions on both black and white music charts proved their wide reach.</p>
			
			<p class="works">Motown Records</p>
			
			<p>In 1959, songwriter and former boxer Berry Gordy, Jr., founded the Motown Record Company in Detroit. In the 1960s, Motown launched the careers of major vocal groups and solo singers that appealed to both black and white audiences, including Diana Ross and the Supremes, Smokey Robinson and the Miracles, the Temptations, Marvin Gaye, and Stevie Wonder. Motown Records updated the R&B style of the 1950s and created its own version of soul music, sometimes called the "Motown Sound," which achieved enormous success.  The songs featured a heavy, even beat, as well as elaborate arrangements with strings and wind instruments. As funk and disco music appeared in the 1970s, Motown continued to produce groundbreaking and immensely popular artists such as Donna Summer and the Jackson Five.</p>
			
			<p>In 1988, Berry Gordy, Jr., sold Motown Records to MCA Universal. The label still exists today; it continues to represent music legends like Stevie Wonder, as well as younger R&B and soul artists such as Brian McKnight and Erykah Badu. In 1991, Gordy received a lifetime achievement Grammy Award that described Motown as "one of the recording and business world’s most inspiring success stories" ("The History of Motown").</p>

		<h2>Shaping New Identities</h2>
		
		<p>During the Black Arts Era, the Black Power Movement was the ultimate expression of African American rejection of the discrimination they had been facing since the arrival of their ancestors on slave ships. Not every black person in the United States had the same opinion on how to affirm this new empowerment, however.</p>

			<p>Sonia Sanchez was born Wilsonia Benita Driver on September 9, 1934, in Birmingham, Alabama. After her mother's death when she was only a year old, Sonia and her sister were raised by their grandmother. After her death, they lived with several relatives before moving in with their father and his third wife in Harlem.</p>
			
			<p>After graduating in political science from Hunter College in 1955, Sonia studied poetry at New York University and started working for the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE). She formed a writers' workshop in Greenwich Village with Amiri Baraka (LeRoi Jones), Haki R. Madhubuti (Don L. Lee), and Larry Neal; she also formed the "Broadside Quartet" of young poets with Madhubuti, Nikki Giovanni, and Etheridge Knight.</p>
	
			<p>Her first marriage (date unknown) to Puerto Rican immigrant Albert Sanchez did not last, but Sonia Sanchez continued writing under his surname.</p>
	
			<p>When she entered the Civil Rights Movement in New York, Sonia Sanchez believed in racial integration, but after hearing a speech by Malcolm X in the early 1960s, she turned to Black Nationalism and started writing vernacular poetry for African Americans.</p>
			
			<p>Sonia Sanchez was a defender of African American Studies programs in colleges and universities. She started teaching in San Francisco in 1965, first at the Downtown Community School, then at San Francisco State University in 1967, where she developed courses for the first Black Studies program. The program  was shut down a few years later by the administration. In the early 1970s, she became the head of the Afro-American Studies program at Ahmerst College, but still faced hostility from the college's deans and president.</p>
			
			<p>In 1972, Sanchez joined the Nation of Islam and became one of its spokespeople. Her views on women's rights differed from those of the organization, however, and she left it in 1975, becoming a professor of English and African American Studies at the University of Pennsylvania.</p>
			
			<p>Sonia Sanchez was a prolific author throughout her academic career. She produced dozens of collections of poetry and short stories, as well as essays, plays, and children's books. Her work depicts the life and challenges of the black population and greatly reflects the oral tradition. She is renowned for her reading performances, in which she used typical African American speech patterns. Her unique style made her one of the most famous poets of the Black Arts Era.</p>
			
			<p>During her career, Sanchez has taught at eight universities and lectured at numerous colleges across the United States. She has received several awards, including the prestigious American Book Award in 1985, for Homegirls and Handgrenades. She was the first Presidential Fellow at Temple University, where she began working in 1977 and where she became a poet-in-residence when she retired in 1999.</p>

		<h2>"Say It Loud! I'm Black and I'm Proud!"</h2>
		
		<p>The Black Power movement encouraged African Americans to take pride in their cultural heritage and to assert themselves politically and socially. Although "Black Power" is often associated with violence because of demonstrations by armed self-defence associations and highly mediatized riots that occurred at the time, the concept has many other facets.

			<p>By the mid-1960s, the non-violent direct actions favoured by leaders of the Civil Rights Movement had contributed to several important victories, including the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the desegregation of schools and other public institutions. Nevertheless, African Americans still faced persistent racism everywhere. In the North and South alike, they were, by customary practice, denied access to many restaurants, movie theatres, nightclubs, and other public accommodations. They paid higher rents in black neighborhoods and were banned from white neighbourhoods, even if they could afford the properties.  Most black workers had low-security, low-pay jobs, regardless of their qualifications. Black doctors, lawyers, and teachers could only find work within the black community. In the United States Army, during the Vietnam War (1959–1975), black soldiers were still discriminated against: few African Americans were given officer positions, most of them were sent to combat units and faced disproportionately high casualities. For that reason, the Black Power Movement was closely associated with opposition to the Vietnam War.</p>
			
			<p>In addition to discrimination, African Americans faced constant intimidation and violence from whites. The bombing of a black church in Birmingham in 1964, which killed four little girls, and the shooting of James Meredith during his one-man March Against Fear in 1966 were additional proof in the eyes of a number of black activists that pacifist demonstrations were not enough. Self-defence against violence from whites became a new priority.</p>
	
			<p>The important roles given to white allies in the Civil Rights Movement frustrated many African Americans, who feared they were losing control of their struggle. Some were also afraid that black leaders would move away from their original goals in order to please white public opinion.</p>
	
			<p>As the black population decided to step up and take control over its own destiny, "Black Power!" became the "new rallying cry of the black freedom struggle" (Trotter 574). The movement did not start on a specific date: the words "Black Power" had been in the air since the 1950s, but their use became popular in the mid-1960s, after Stokely Carmichael, a young SNCC activist, used them in a speech.</p>
			
			<p>In many spheres of the African American community, Black Power became associated with Black Nationalism. Many civil rights groups such as CORE and the SNCC started rejecting race integration and, after close votes, banned whites from their meetings. Black revolutionary organizations were formed, many—like the Black Panther Party—advocating the use of arms for self-defence. Revolutionary and Marxist philosophies also reached black workers; black labour unions, such as the Revolutionary Union Movements, were formed and did not hesitate to go on strike to protect their members. Many black ministers of all confessions, such as Reverend Albert Cleage, Jr., endorsed Black Power and preached liberation theology. Black students formed associations in colleges and universities and engaged in demonstrations, boycotts, and sometimes civil disobedience to increase the number of black students and professors, courses on black culture, and African American Studies programs in major institutions.</p>
			
			<p>The concept of black power was general enough to encompass many ideologies and strategies. Some advocated that Black Power would be achieved through black capitalism. Creating community-based, black-owned businesses was not enough: African American politicians and economists encouraged blacks to take jobs in large corporations and form a new generation of black managers and executive officers.</p>
			
			<p>To others, achieving Black Power was a political matter. There were various visions within the movement. Some favoured armed struggle, while others focused on political influence. Others endorsed pan-Africanism, promoting the unity of all blacks of the world in one African community. Others still valued integrationist philosophies from the Civil Rights Movement, aiming for the cohabitation of blacks and whites in society.</p>
			
			<p>These various interpretations of Black Power led to internal conflicts within the black community, but the concept itself encouraged  all African Americans to be assertive and proud of their heritage. In this way, Black Power was a lever for social change in the late 1960s and early 1970s.</p>

			<p>As the Black Power Movement rose between the mid-1960s and the early 1970s, so did the feelings of powerlessness of many African Americans, who, despite the efforts of civil rights organizations, still faced discrimination, poverty, and police brutality. Fuelled by decades of unchanged living conditions and white resistance, dozens of riots erupted over several years in cities such as Los Angeles, Newark, Detroit, Baltimore, and Milwaukee, sometimes sparked off by some small event. In the summer and fall of 1966 alone, some 40 cities experienced racial violence (Trotter 558). After the assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr., in April 1968, another wave of violent riots took place. The authorities' response to these uprisings was harsh; the National Guard and sometimes federal troops were sent in to assist overwhelmed local police. In the most violent riots, thousands of people were arrested, hundreds were injured, and dozens were killed.</p>
			
			<p>The federal government was also preoccupied by the rise of black power, especially by Black Nationalist organizations that mobilized poor and working-class blacks and encouraged opposition to the Vietnam War. Early on, members of CORE, the SNCC, the SCLC, and the Nation of Islam were placed under tight surveillance, and black power organizations were infiltrated. The Black Panther Party and other radical groups were violently attacked by local police and the FBI, and several of their members killed or arrested.</p>
	
			<p>Riots and violent encounters with the police were not the only manifestation of the increasing dissatisfaction of African Americans. In order to receive better treatment in colleges and universities, black student associations engaged in acts of civil disobedience and almost placed certain institutions under siege. In universities such as Cornell and Duke, black students submitted their list of "non-negociable demands" (Trotter 577) to the administration and started boycotting classes, picketing classrooms and offices, and occupying buildings.</p>
	
			<p>To increase their influence in politics, some African Americans used a more conventional approach. Black Power conferences, given by black professionals, businessmen, and public officials, were organized to mobilize the black electorate and help elect African Americans to public office in all levels of government. It worked: from 100 black elected officials in 1965 to 1,200 in 1969 to 3,500 in 1975. Some owed their victory to white support, but in cities such as Cleveland, Ohio, and Gary, Indiana, the almost unanimous vote of black citizens was key in electing the first and second black mayors in the United States in 1967.</p>
			
			<p>In the African American community today, there are various opinions on what demonstrations of violence did (or did not do) for the Black Power Movement. Politically, by achieving better representation at the state and federal levels, African Americans increased their impact on public policy and made important gains in education and employment. With the adoption of desegregation and affirmative action policies, they gained access to better services and jobs.</p>

			<p>In 1966, two black students, Huey Newton and Bobby Seale, founded the Black Panther Party for Self-Defense in Oakland, California. The founders disclosed the objectives of the party in a ten-point platform that could be summarized in its last point: “We want land, bread, housing, education, clothing, justice, and peace.”  Strongly inspired by Malcolm X's teachings of  racial dignity, self-reliance, and self-defence, the Black Panthers drew on a combination of Black Nationalism and socialism to found a black revolutionary party. They defended their right to bear arms and "affirmed the right of blacks to use violence to defend themselves and thus became an alternative to more moderate civil rights groups" (Carson n. pag.).</p>
			
			<p>At its peak in the late 1960s, the Black Panther Party boasted over 2,000 members in several major cities.  From originally patrolling black neighbourhoods to protect residents from acts of police brutality, the Black Panthers evolved into a Marxist group that promoted mass organizing and community-based programs. For example, the Black Panther Party ran a successful Breakfast for School Children program that fed over 10,000 children every day in various cities.</p>
	
			<p>The Black Panther Party did not follow certain lines of the Black Power Movement, such as the exclusion of white activists from their ranks. Black Panthers formed alliances with white associations, such as the Students for a Democratic Society and the Weathermen, "because they believed that all revolutionaries that wanted to change US society should unite across racial lines" (Carson n. pag.).</p>
	
			<p>In 1969, at a time when racial tensions reached a peak in the United States, the director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), John Edgar Hoover, labelled the Black Panthers "the greatest threat to the internal security of the country" (Baggins n. pag.). While some members of the party were indeed guilty of criminal acts, the group was subject to police harassment which sometimes degenerated into violence.</p>
			
			<p>In the late 1960s and early 1970s, shoot-outs involving police and Black Panthers took place in California, New York, and Chicago. During one of those shoot-outs, founder Huey Newton killed a patrolman and was sent to prison. Over the years, many party members were killed or imprisoned, sometimes on false charges. This eventually led to congressional investigations of police activities related to the Black Panther Party.</p>
			
			<p>By the mid-1970s, many African American leaders disapproved of the violent methods of the Black Panther Party. The party began to focus on more traditional politics and service to black communities. As the party lost or expelled many of its founding members for being excessively radical or for illicit activities, it lost its influence little by little and was finally disbanded in the early 1980s.</p>

			<p>After the desegregation of major league baseball in 1947, other sports followed, and many African Americans soon distinguished themselves in baseball, tennis, basketball, football, and, most importantly, boxing.</p>
			
			<p>Boxing had a high symbolic value for African Americans;  throughout the 1960s, black boxers completely dominated the heavyweight category. In the mid-1960s, one fighter embodied the rise of the Black Power Movement: Cassius Clay, who converted to Islam and changed his name to Muhammad Ali after winning the World Championship in 1964. After his conversion, whites perceived Ali as a "symbol of revolt" (Trotter 602), but his following victories and his stand against racism made him a resistance hero in the eyes of many African Americans.</p>
	
			<p>Muhammad Ali endorsed Black Nationalism. He also denounced the Vietnam War and refused to appear for induction into the US Army on account of his religious beliefs. In response, the federal government took away his championship title and forbade him to fight in the United States. These events encouraged a growing number of black athletes to support the Black Power Movement.</p>
	
			<p>While certain athletes decided to boycott the 1968 Olympic Games in Mexico City, many others participated, but nevertheless showed their support for Black Power. The most spectacular protest was certainly that of sprinters Tommie Smith and John Carlos. Standing on the podium after winning the gold medal and bronze medals in the 200m race, the two men performed the Black Panther salute (gloved fist in the air) and bowed their head while the United States National Anthem played. Like Muhammed Ali, both men suffered heavy consequences (confiscation of medals, expulsion from the US team . . . ), but their actions launched a wave of protests from black athletes in American universities demanding equal rights and fair treatment.</p>

			<p>During the Civil Rights and Black Power Movements, the "black is beautiful" philosophy was embraced by many African Americans.</p>
			
			<p>At the time, white European standards of beauty dominated the United States. Darkness was considered inferior, which deeply affected African Americans and even created issues of caste within this community. For example, the "paper bag test" was used in certain African American groups or social events in order to admit only individuals with complexions at least as light as a brown paper bag.</p>
	
			<p>In order to dispel the prejudice that black people's natural features such as skin colour, facial features, and hair were less attractive, the "black is beautiful" movement "encouraged black men and women to stop straightening their hair and attempting to lighten or bleach their skin ("Black is beautiful" n. pag.). This contributed to the emergence of new beauty standards in American mainstream culture, especially the popularity of the Afro hairstyle in the 1960s and 1970s.</p>
