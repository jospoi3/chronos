		<h2>Barriers to Progress</h2>
			
			<p>During the Harlem Renaissance, African American artists extended their influence and development widely around the world, but there were still considerable barriers to the overall progress of the black population in American society.</p>

			<p>In the 1920s, the legal struggles of civil rights organizations against Jim Crow laws motivated the black population to increase its participation in politics. African American grassroots organizations worked hard to help their community survive the hardships that followed World War I and, later, the Great Depression. Their understanding of the dire conditions faced by blacks made them more organized, more determined, and more proactive. Because of their involvement, African Americans gained elected office (in Chicago, for example) and had an opportunity to change discriminatory policies.</p>
			
			<p>Traditionally, African Americans had been more involved in the Republican Party—the party of Abraham Lincoln. Within the party, African Americans demanded more influential positions and increased representation. Even in the South, black republicans formed alliances with white republicans. Despite Jim Crow policies, the black population's votes played key roles in close elections, and African Americans managed to retain positions on state committees, where they helped secure jobs for their community.</p>
	
			<p>After the stock market crash in 1929, however, the harsh economic conditions spawned a worldwide shift to the political left. In the United States, the Communist and Socialist Parties attracted many African Americans because they endorsed anti-lynching laws and labour unions, and elevated blacks to leadership positions within their ranks.</p>
	
			<p>In the end, it was the Democratic Party that managed to win the support of African Americans during the Great Depression, with 76% of the northern black vote in the 1933 presidential election. This historical shift was due in part to Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal, a plan to support the basic needs of the poor. At first,  the relief programs were highly discriminatory, and Roosevelt's position on civil rights was weak because he needed approval from the white segregationists in the South. He opposed anti-lynching legislation, refused to make racial equality a priority, and prevented black delegations from visiting the White House. His position gradually shifted toward significant support, however, due to the influence of his wife, First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt. Mrs. Roosevelt was concerned by the treatment of African Americans and had grown close to many black leaders and activists, including Mary McLeod Bethune, a major leader of grassroots black women's associations.</p>
			
			<p>In 1933, 15 black organizations (including the NAACP and the National Urban League) formed the Joint Committee on National Recovery (JCNR) and put pressure on the federal government for more representation in New Deal agencies. This resulted in 45 appointments in various agencies and cabinet departments. This "Black Cabinet" included Mary McLeod Bethune and other long-time activists, as well as Harvard-trained men like Robert W. Weaver and John P. Davis. Under their counsel, African Americans gained greater access to governmental relief programs.</p>

			<p>In the 1920s and 1930s, it was extremely difficult for African Americans to find jobs. Even white philanthropists who supported black colleges and social projects like those of Booker T. Washington preferred to hire white Americans and immigrants to fill their labour needs.  Chinese workers were preferred in railroad construction.  In cities, Irish and German men were favoured in labour jobs and skilled trades.</p>
			
			<p>Securing jobs was also hard for blacks in rural areas. In the South, cotton prices dropped and machinery replaced manual labour. African Americans were excluded from new jobs based on stereotypes. White employers believed that blacks could not operate machines and that the noise would make them fall asleep. Blacks who attempted to find work in southern cities were received with slogans like "Niggers, back to cotton fields—city jobs are for white folks" (Trotter 438). White brotherhoods like the KKK intimidated, attacked, and sometimes murdered blacks who went looking for jobs on the railroad or elsewhere.</p>
	
			<p>Inequality existed in unemployment as well. During the Great Depression, racial discrimination was common in the New Deal relief programs. For example, the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) hired unemployed young men in conservation and reforestation work, but even in counties where blacks constituted the majority of the population (in Alabama or Mississippi, for example), they were given less than 6% of the CCC jobs. Black families also received less money from welfare programs. The situation started to improve when the advisers of the Black Cabinet formed during Roosevelt's presidency started putting pressure on aid agencies to provide better services for African Americans.</p>
	
			<p>African Americans responded to the limits of the welfare programs by massively entering the labour movement.  All-black unions had existed since1866, because at the time, many labour organizations restricted their membership to whites, and interracial unions remained segregated. Black unions had little success in improving the situation of African American workers in the 1920s, but things started changing during the Great Depression.</p>
			
			<p>With the growing awareness of the precariousness of unskilled workers' conditions, national labour movements started recruiting in mass production industries such as transportation, steel, automobile, rubber, and meat-packing. African Americans had been in these sectors since World War I, but their needs had been ignored until then. As the positions of all workers were jeopardized during the Depression, white labour leaders gradually realized that there was a need for a more egalitarian labour movement.</p>
			
			<p>In order to appeal to black workers, unions connected labour organization to civil rights recognition and placed African Americans in leadership positions. At first, black workers were highly sceptical, having been ignored and rejected for decades, but in the end, growing numbers of black men and women supported the new unions in the hope of overcoming abuse from employers.</p>
			
			<p>Labour organization was not without risk. Violent anti-union attacks occurred everywhere, especially in the South, where blacks were harassed by employers, local police, and white union leaders. Beatings and shootings by hired hands were common. Labour relations were also difficult within the African American community, as the black business elite working in banking, insurance, and cosmetics withdrew from the unionization movements.</p>
			
			<p>Despite the hardships, African Americans managed to develop new labour relations by getting involved in worker organization. They improved their economic status and reinforced their political presence, although they still faced disproportionate levels of poverty and unemployment at the end of the 1930s. Only the expansion of military industries during World War II would truly help them out of the Great Depression.</p>

			<p>The number of African Americans living in cities had been steadily increasing since Emancipation. The development of the railroad in the United States facilitated the relocation of African Americans from the South during the Great Migration and allowed black immigrants from Canada and the West Indies to travel to northern cities such as New York, Cleveland, Chicago, and Philadelphia. The white population was alarmed by the arrival of so many blacks, so public officials took steps to restrict settlement in their municipalities.</p>
			
			<p>In the 1920s, restrictive covenants (legal agreements) were adopted by white property owners to prevent African Americans as well as Latin Americans, Asians, and Jews from buying or renting properties in certain areas. In many cities, real estate boards were instructed not to sell or rent to "coloured" people in established white neighbourhoods.</p>
	
			<p>In many towns, white citizens did not wait for official policies to expel African Americans from their area. After World War I, frustrated by the increasing presence of blacks and by the fact that some black soldiers came back from Europe with honours, whites used extreme violence against them. In urban areas, "race riots" took place, with mobs taking over cities for days at a time, destroying black property and beating and even killing African Americans and their white allies. For example, some 25 race riots took place in northern and southern cities during the first six months of 1919. The worst of all was in Chicago, where more than 70 African Americans were lynched in six months. Lynching was common in the countryside, especially in the South, where white mobs were led by racist brotherhoods.  Everywhere, police joined the mobs, and city officials did nothing to protect African Americans from the general anger.</p>
	
			<p>The combination of municipal covenants and interracial violence increased the expansion of segregated neighbourhoods during the Harlem Renaissance. By 1930, more than 90% of the African American residents of certain cities, such as Cleveland and Milwaukee, were living in segregated areas. Residential discrimination led to overcrowded, unsanitary, and overpriced housing.  Real estate speculators bought mansions in older parts of the city and divided them into small apartments, for which landlords charged black tenants exorbitant rents.</p>
			
			<p>In these conditions, African Americans had to continue their historic reliance on community and family.  Black women played a major role in family survival. They took in boarders, offered child care, and bartered food and clothing. In suburban and rural areas, they maintained gardens. One creative source of income was the "rent party," inspired by southern traditions. The sponsors charged a small admission fee, and participants enjoyed home cooking, dancing, and music. Adding number games and liquor made the party even more lucrative. Indeed, like their poor white counterparts, African Americans took part in the underground economy of bootlegging, gambling, and theft in order to survive.</p>

		<h2>Significant Contributions</h2>
			
			<p>The Harlem Renaissance was an artistic and cultural rebirth for African Americans. Some of the most significant works in African American literature were published during this period, including the writings of poet Langston Hughes. The world also discovered jazz, which became a major African American contribution to the international music scene.</p>
			
			<p>At the same time, the ongoing discrimination faced by African Americans convinced many of them that they should live apart from the white community. Some even advocated a union with other black peoples and a mass return to Africa. One of the most ardent defenders of this philosophy was Marcus Garvey, a prominent activist for Black Nationalism who left an extensive written legacy.</p>

			<p class="citation">It will be useless, as before stated, for bombastic Negroes to leave America and the West Indies to go to Africa, thinking that they will have privileged positions to inflict upon the race that bastard aristocracy that they have tried to maintain in this Western world at the expense of the masses. Africa shall develop an aristocracy of its own, but it shall be based upon service and loyalty to race. Let all Negroes work toward that end. I feel that it is only a question of a few more years before our program will be accepted not only by the few statesmen of America who are now interested in it, but by the strong statesmen of the world, as the only solution to the great race problem.<br />

			<p>Marcus Garvey is mostly known for his speeches and essays, many of which were published in Negro World,  the newspaper he founded in 1918.</p>
			
			<p>A collection of these writings was compiled by his second wife, Amy Jacques Garvey, under the title The Philosophy and Opinions of Marcus Garvey. It was published for the first time, in two volumes, in 1923 and 1925.</p>
	
			<p>In 1937, Marcus Garvey produced a book containing 22 lessons called Course of African Philosophy. It was designed exclusively for a group of elite members of the Universal Negro Improvement Association (UNIA) who studied Garvey's teachings during a month-long course. In 1986, the book was published as Message to the People: The Course of African Philosophy by Marcus Garvey.</p>
	
			<p> Marcus Garvey's literary contribution is not limited to essays; he also wrote numerous poems. In 1927, Amy Jacques Garvey put together a collection of his poetic writings in Selections from The Poetic Meditations of Marcus Garvey. Many other poems were published in Negro World (1927) and in the magazine The Black Man (1933–1939). Garvey also wrote hymns for UNIA conventions which were later collected in the book UNIA  Convention Hymns (1934).</p>

			<p>Langston Hughes' career truly developed in the Harlem Renaissance, during which he defended the right of black writers to experiment and to explore all aspects of African American life, even the most infamous ones.</p>
			
			<p>Like some of his contemporaries, Hughes integrated elements of jazz and blues into his work, helping create an original new form of poetry (jazz poetry). He was also deeply involved in theatre and founded his own company: the Harlem Suitcase Theater.</p>
	
			<p>Hughes was an innovative and prolific author, and his career transcended the Harlem Renaissance. His main publications are:</p>

			<p>Blues music first appeared in the southern United States between 1870 and 1900, an era that coincides with the end of the Reconstruction Period. As juke joints developed (places where African Americans listened to music, danced, and sometimes gambled after work), the popularity of blues music grew.</p>
			
			<p>Derived from the African oral tradition, blues music grew out of the spirituals and work songs sung by African American slaves. The term "blues" refers to the "blue devils": melancholy and sadness. Like its predecessors, blues music expresses deep emotions, like the pain of lost love and injustice, through flatted notes called "blue notes" because of their omnipresence in that style. Blues music also features the call-and-response technique, but transforms it into an interplay of voice and instrument (early blues players used the banjo, but it was soon replaced by the guitar).</p>
	
			<p>On the other hand, in blues numbers, group performances that characterized spirituals and work songs were replaced by a more individualized style. Many argue that this development in the 1900s was due in part to the influence of new African American values like independence and self-awareness, introduced by Booker T. Washington and other black leaders of the time.</p>
	
			<p>Blues directly influenced many musical styles that emerged in the 1920s, including rhythm and blues, rock 'n' roll, and country music, but jazz was certainly one of its most original offspring.</p>
			
			<p>It is said that jazz music was born in New Orleans in the first decade of the 20th century. As immigrants arrived in that city, African American musicians merged European music with blues, ragtime, and marching band to create the jazz style. Like blues, it has a strong rhythmic under-structure, blue notes, solos, and call-and-response patterns, but its main characteristic is the use of improvisation.</p>
			
			<p>The popularity of blues and jazz skyrocketed in the 1920s. During the Great Migration, many black musicians moved to cities such as Chicago, St. Louis, and New York and introduced blues and jazz to the northern states. Minstrel shows, circuses, and vaudeville shows that toured the country featured blues singers and bands. Radios and recordings were easily accessible, and young Americans everywhere started listening and dancing to those styles. During World War I, Europe discovered jazz thanks to American soldiers.</p>
			
			<p>Many black artists' careers were launched during those years. On the blues scene, Mamie Smith sang on the first blues record (Crazy Blues) in 1920. Other female singers like Ethel Waters and Bessie Smith and musicians like Blind Lemon Jefferson were precursors of the style. On the jazz side, Louis Armstrong and Joseph Oliver became major figures of the genre. Jazz pianists such as Fats Weller also emerged. "Big bands" were formed starting in 1923, with black directors such as Andy Kirk and Duke Ellington.</p>
			
			<p>During the Harlem Renaissance, blues and jazz inspired many artists. Even writers incorporated these styles in their works, not only in terms of topics, but also in terms of rhythm. For example, Langston Hughes, Paul Lawrence Dunbar, and others founded a new literary genre—jazz poetry—that included jazz rhythm and elements of improvisation. Over the years, blues and jazz evolved into many styles and substyles (urban blues, fusion jazz, etc.) and grew to become international phenomena.  They are among the most important African American contributions to the music world.</p>

			<p><strong>Early Nationalism</strong> (1775–1828): In this period, American authors and poets still write in the English style, but choose characters, themes, and settings that are typically American. Many slave narratives are written during this period. Important authors: Harriet Jacobs, Frederick Douglass, Phillis Wheatley.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Romanticism/Transcendentalism</strong> (1828–1865): Romantic literature appeals to emotion and imagination rather than reason. Problems of everyday life are left aside; writers concentrate on beauty and nature, although sometimes in a grotesque or gothic style. Writings are idealistic and often feature improbable plots and characters. Important authors: Edgar Allan Poe, Harriet Beecher Stowe, Harriet Wilson.</p>
	
			<p><strong>Realism/Naturalism</strong> (1865–1900): Realism and romanticism are opposites. Writers of realistic fiction want to represent life as it is. They focus on the commonplace and the daily experience. The characters are ordinary people who control their own destiny. They are explored in depth, and character is generally more important than plot. Important authors: Mark Twain, Henry James.</p>
	
			<p>Naturalism claims to be even closer to life than realism. Harsh and often tragic, naturalist literature examines life with scientific objectivity. The characters' behaviour depends solely on heredity and environment. Important authors: Jack London.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Modernism</strong> (1900–1960): In this period, American authors experiment with subject matter and style in all literary genres. Many creative works feature an original use of literary devices such as imagery and diction. Disillusioned with the affairs of the time, artists try using their art to answer fundamental questions. They reconsider social norms and make alienation from society one of their major themes. Writers are interested in the urban experience, as well as in folklore and primitivism. The African American literature of this era specifically includes the blues tradition and the themes of liberation and revolt. Important authors: Langston Hughes, W.E.B. Du Bois, Ernest Hemingway.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Postmodernism</strong> (1960–today): At the beginning of this period, when liberation movements reached a peak, postmodern writers took advantage of the loosening of censorship to discuss controversial topics. Adventure, sexual fantasies, black humour, and journalistic essays became trends. Postmodernism can be hard to distinguish from modernism. It is characterized by a heavy emphasis on irony, playfulness, and parody, although these techniques are not used by all writers.  Important authors: Ralph Ellison, Maya Angelou, Arthur Miller, Jack Kerouac.</p>

		<h2>Meet Them in Harlem</h2>
			
			<p>The Harlem Renaissance was a significant time in the development of African American culture, and Harlem was the place to be for black intellectuals and artists. The effervescence of the New York City neighbourhood attracted many writers who eventually left their mark on African American literature, including activist Marcus Garvey and poet Langston Hughes.</p>

			<p>Marcus Mosiah Garvey, Jr., was born in St. Ann's Bay, Jamaica, on August 17, 1887. The youngest of 11 children, Garvey developed an interest in books through his exposure to the extensive family library. He attended school until the age of 14, when he started working as an apprentice at his godfather's printing business. There, he became interested in social and political affairs. After becoming a master printer and foreman, he led a strike for higher wages in 1908, which terminated his employment.</p>
			
			<p>From 1910 to 1912, Garvey travelled to South and Central America, where he worked and observed the difficult working conditions of blacks and West Indians. He moved to London in 1912 to attend Birbeck College.  While there, he read Booker T. Washington's Up from Slavery, which had a major impact on his life. It made him think that blacks needed leadership and a country of their own, and that unity was their only way of improvement. </p>
	
			<p>Ready for action, Garvey returned to Jamaica in 1914 and, with Amy Ashwood, co-founded the Universal Negro Improvement and Conservation Association and African Communities League, which became known as the Universal Negro Improvement Association (UNIA). Its goals were to encourage racial pride, promote cultural and political independence for blacks (Black Nationalism), create an independent black economy, and educate black children in schools modelled on Booker T. Washington's Tuskegee Institute.</p>
	
			<p>In order to raise funds, Garvey travelled to the United States in 1916. He established himself in Harlem and founded branches of the UNIA in several northern cities.  He became a popular speaker and launched Negro World, a weekly newspaper, in 1918. In his essays and speeches, he encouraged African Americans to be proud of their race and to return to Africa to build their own society. After a few years, Garvey had thousands of followers, but also many opponents. Several black leaders, including W.E.B. Du Bois, did not approve of his ideas on racial purity and separatism. Nevertheless, Garvey's beliefs were not one of a kind: strong nationalist doctrines would eventually start spreading in many countries in the 1930s, especially in Europe.</p>
			
			<p>In 1919, Garvey founded the Black Star Line, a shipping line that would facilitate the return of blacks to Africa (mainly to Liberia), and the Negro Factories Corporation, to encourage the black economy. The UNIA's popularity had reached its peak by then (with approximately 1,100 branches in more than 40 countries), and in 1920, the UNIA’s first international convention was organized in Harlem, with delegates from 25 countries.</p>
			
			<p>At that time, Garvey's popularity attracted the attention of the United States government. After an investigation into his businesses, Garvey was arrested for mail fraud in relation to the Black Star ship line. The company had been in financial trouble since its beginnings, and Garvey had launched a mail campaign to raise money. Despite the irregularities found in that business, many thought that the arrest was rather a political move.</p>
			
			<p>After serving more than two years in jail, Garvey was deported to Jamaica in 1927. Most of his businesses had failed, and he had to rebuild the UNIA's prestige on his own. He moved permanently to London in 1935, where he remained active within the UNIA. He died on June 10, 1940.</p>
			
			<p>Marcus Garvey's fervent support of Black Nationalism made him an extremely popular but controversial figure.  Although he failed to achieve most of his goals for the black population (return to Africa, worldwide independent black economy ...), his discourse on racial pride and self-reliance remains a reference for African Americans and black cultures in general.</p>

			<p>James Mercer Langston Hughes was born in 1902, in Joplin, Missouri. He grew up mostly in Lawrence, Kansas, where he was raised by his grandmother following his parents' divorce. When he was 13 years old, he moved to Illinois, where he could be with his mother and her husband. There he started writing poetry.  After graduating from high school, Hughes joined his father in Mexico. Hughes's father, a biracial man like his son, had moved there to escape racism. All his life, Hughes had a tense relationship with his father, who was  "a very complex man who tried to emulate white people in order to rise above the social and economic limitations imposed by race" (Lamb 8). In the train that brought him to Mexico, Hughes wrote the poem "The Negro Speaks of Rivers," which appeared in the magazine The Crisis a year later and immediately launched his literary career.</p>
			
			<p>In September 1921, Hughes moved to New York to attend Columbia University and discover Harlem. He soon left the university and spent the following years doing multiple odd jobs, many of which allowed him to travel abroad. Meanwhile, he continued to write and publish poems. In 1926, Hughes published his first poetry collection (The Weary Blues) and returned to school at Lincoln University in Pennsylvania.</p>
	
			<p>The same year, Hughes published "The Negro Artist and the Racial Mountain," an essay defending race pride and artistic independence. This work became a manifesto for a movement that would later be called the Harlem Renaissance and made Hughes a major figure of the movement. In his writings, Hughes promoted racial pride and cultural nationalism, as well as their use as a source of inspiration.</p>
	
			<p>In 1927, Hughes met Charlotte Osgood Mason, a white patron of the arts who supported several African American artists. Their professional relationship lasted three years, but  ended abruptly after a dispute. Afterwards, Hughes left for Haiti, unhappy and disappointed. When he returned to the United States in 1931, his verse took a radical turn to the political left.  </p>
			
			<p>Becoming more and more pessimistic about race relations, Hughes thought that communism might be an alternative to segregation. He sympathized with a few communist-led organizations, and some of his poetry and essays were published in a journal controlled by the Communist Party. Hughes returned to a less radical approach when World War II began, but his ties with the Left came back to haunt him years later, when he was forced to appear in front of Senator Joseph McCarthy's Permanent Subcommittee on Investigation in 1953.</p>
			
			<p>His career did not suffer from this event, as McCarthy was soon discredited. In fact, in the 1940s and 1950s, Hughes became prosperous. In addition to collections of poetry and short stories, he produced novels, children's books, plays, musicals, anthologies of African American literature, and several volumes of his autobiography. But not all his works were successes. Throughout his career, many critics rejected his literary experiments (mainly with blues and jazz) and found his references to working class black culture tasteless. As the Civil Rights Movement gave way to Black Power in the 1960s, Hughes strongly encouraged black pride. But as the tendency swung towards racial integration, many young black writers found him chauvinistic and out-of-date.</p>
			
			<p>Nevertheless, Hughes's versatility and his talent for depicting urban black culture were widely acknowledged. His success in writing literature about and for African Americans made him the most renowned black American poet and a major figure in African American literature. His constant hard work allowed him to purchase a house in his beloved Harlem, where he spent the rest of his life. Langston Hughes passed away on May 22, 1967.</p>

		<h2>Great Times and Hard Times</h2>
			
			<p>During the Harlem Renaissance, despite the day-to-day difficulties they faced, African Americans were carried forward by a wave of pride and enthusiasm, especially in northern cities. After a major economic disaster hit the United States in 1929, however, the general ebullience slowed down as the black population was forced to confront straitened living conditions and growing discrimination.</p>

			<p>On October 28, 1929, the United States stock market suddenly collapsed due to a combination of internal weaknesses and various events. The market fell 22.6% in one day, the largest drop in its history. The next day, panic-stricken investors all tried to sell their stocks at once, and the market dropped another 12.8%. Despite the efforts of Wall Street and the financial elite, the market did not recover. The crash spread to other stock markets and a worldwide depression followed for the next decade, with disastrous consequences in most industrial countries.</p>
			
			<p>In the United States, between 1929 and 1932, the national income dropped 50%, and unemployment went from 3.2% to 24.8%, leaving 15 million Americans out of work. People with jobs faced major salary cuts or had to work part-time. Hundreds of businesses closed, and by March 1933, more than 5,000 banks had failed, swallowing up the savings of millions of people. In addition to their jobs and savings, many lost their houses as well; thousands of homeless people gathered in shanty towns outside cities. The situation was equally difficult in the countryside. Food prices fell and farmers could no longer make a profit on their crops. Furthermore, natural disasters in the 1930s forced thousands of farmers who lost everything to migrate to California in search of work. African American sharecroppers were evicted from the farms and found themselves on the road as well.</p>
	
			<p>African Americans suffered considerably during the Great Depression. Their living conditions went from bad to worse. Unemployment rose and remained disproportionally high. For example, in Chicago, 40% of black men and 55% of black women were unemployed, versus 23% of white men and 13% of white women. The black economy that had developed since the Reconstruction Period collapsed, because black professionals depended on the consumption of the black masses. African Americans faced harsh racism and many challenges in employment and housing during this period.</p>
	
			<p>In 1933, Americans elected President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who created relief programs known as the New Deal to overcome the effects of the Great Depression. Unfortunately, the New Deal was more of an "old deal" for African Americans, as they suffered discrimination within the welfare programs. As a result, blacks stepped up their participation in the civil rights struggle for greater access to governmental aid.</p>
			
			<p>The New Deal did help the American economy, but the Great Depression only truly ended with the start of World War II in Europe in 1939. The United States government increased its spending to produce war materials and reinforce the national defence system, which stimulated industrial growth and created jobs. After the United States entered the war in December 1941, the war effort stimulated every sector of the American economy. Many African Americans were among the six million defence workers and six million soldiers recruited at the time, but they still endured discrimination in the industry and the military.</p>

			<p>Although the existence of the Harlem Renaissance is contested by certain experts who believe it is simply an extension of the New Negro Renaissance, the period from 1919 to 1940 was one of exceptional creativity in African American art. Black artists were brought to light with the help of black intellectuals and their white allies and patrons. This effervescence was seen in major northern cities, such as Chicago and Philadelphia, but it was most evident in New York, in the Harlem neighbourhood.</p>
			
			<p>Harlem became the "black cultural capital of the world" (Trotter 415) following the Great Migration, when thousands of African Americans left the southern United States to find a better life in northern cities. Many immigrants from Africa and the West Indies also converged on New York, making up approximately 25% of the black population in Harlem. One reason many new settlers chose Harlem was because of the many good quality houses available there. The area had been overbuilt, and real estates agencies were eager to sell, so it was easier for blacks to buy property.</p>
	
			<p>With more than 200,000 inhabitants of African descent, Harlem attracted many important black associations, such as the National Urban League, the NAACP, and the UNIA, which established their headquarters in the neighbourhood. Socialist associations were also very active locally, taking advantage of black disenchantment with the federal government. Dozens of African American magazines and newspapers were founded in Harlem and helped spread the works of black artists through sponsored contests and social events. All this action fascinated African American creators and scholars.  Author Langston Hughes wrote: "Harlem was like a great magnet for the Negro intellectual, pulling him from everywhere. Once in New York, he had to live in Harlem" (Powell and Bailey 162).</p>
	
			<p>Major black cultural figures reached the height of their careers during the Harlem Renaissance, including painter Aaron Douglas, writer Langston Hughes, jazz musician Duke Ellington, blues singer Bessie Smith, dancer Josephine Baker, and performer Paul Robeson. In the theatre, the first plays featuring black actors expressing complex emotions and situations were created in that era. In 1921–1922, the black musical Shuffle Along was the most popular show in New York, and Harlem dance halls rivalled Broadway. One example of this musical achievement was the Savoy Ballroom, white owned but black operated, which featured black and white jazz musicians and hosted 4,000 dancers every night.</p>
			
			<p>There was antagonism during the Harlem Renaissance between artists and intellectuals and working class blacks, older and younger writers, and conservative and experimental artists, but despite their differences, they all had a common goal: to resist poverty and racism by affirming the dignity and humanity of the black population.  This movement influenced African American artists all over the United States and found its way to black communities in the West Indies and even in Paris.  Celebrities from all over the world came in pilgrimage to Harlem, including Marcus Garvey, Malcolm X, Max Weber, Carl Jung, Octavio Paz, Nelson Mandela, and, later, Fidel Castro. As Langston Hughes once wrote, "Harlem was not so much a place as a state of mind, the cultural metaphor for black America itself" (Powell and Bailey 162).</p>

			<p>In art, traditional patronage refers to the financial and social support of an artist by wealthy individuals or organizations.</p>
			
			<p>Critics state that white patronage was essential to the growth of the Harlem Renaissance. According to Michele Birnbaum, "nearly all the major figures of the Harlem Renaissance had financial underwriting and social support from white philantropists and organizations" (100). Indeed, the African American community did not have the financial means to support a large-scale artistic movement. A great many white patrons, attracted by the new interest in the "primitive background" of black authors, soon complemented the small emerging group of black sponsors such as the African American Press publications. Well-known white patrons of the Harlem Renaissance include writer and photographer Carl Van Vechten, as well as philanthropist Charlotte Osgood Mason.</p>
	
			<p>The impact of white patronage on the Harlem Renaissance has ignited many debates. Some claim that the extension of interracial and intellectual relationships over the traditional boundaries contributed to the development of institutions that supported the movement (Birnbaum 100). On the other hand, other critics believe that the white patrons' admiration for the emotionalism and primitivism of the black culture mainly encouraged instant gratification and consumerism and did little to support the political aspirations of African Americans. According to some, excessive white publicity of black culture "mobilized African American music and culture in ways that reinforced racist stereotypes and opened the door to a new kind of popular culture that, ironically, was available to whites only" ("The Harlem Renaissance").</p>
	
			<p>Beyond the debates, the importance of white patronage to the Harlem Renaissance cannot be ignored; it even became a topic of African American works, such as Langston Hughes's 1935 play Mulatto. But the phenomenon had been an intrinsic part of African American literature since its beginnings. For instance, Antebellum slave narratives typically included a preface by whites that attested of the "reliability and good character of the narrator" (Gates and McKay 518). Poet Phillis Wheatley is an early example of white patronage: her master reduced her workload as a house slave and supported the publication of her works socially and financially.</p>
			
			<p>In later years, patronage passed largely from individual wealth to professional power or commercial interest. With the rise of capitalism in Western society, the patronage system split into two streams: a public system of universities, libraries, and theatres, and a commercial system led by literary editors and library owners, supported by mass audiences and mass consumption.</p>
