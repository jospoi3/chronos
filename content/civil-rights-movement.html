		<h2>Living with Injustice</h2>
			
			<p>In the 1940s and 50s, African Americans experienced injustice and discrimination on a daily basis. Although the black community in the United States had greatly progressed since the Emancipation Proclamation, a significant portion of the white population still harshly resisted its integration. African Americans continued to face the same challenges, and their discontent kept rising ...</p>

			<p>During World War II, hundreds of thousands of African Americans working on farms in the South moved to northern and western cities to take jobs in new war industries such as avionics, electronics, and chemicals. There, they suffered less racism than in the South and received  higher incomes, which led to the growth of the black middle class. After the war, northern and western blacks used their increased economic and political influence to support southern blacks in their civil rights demands.</p>
			
			<p>On the post-war job market, many urban African Americans enjoyed a low unemployment rate and improved working conditions: increases in wages and salaries (from 54% of a white person's salary in 1947 to 64% in 1951) and seniority provisions in work contracts that allowed a few  to keep their jobs during lay-offs. But despite these measures, African American workers continued to bear the effects of segregation: young white men generally kept their jobs over senior black men, and young black men were still the last hired and first fired.</p>
	
			<p>Blacks faced new employment challenges after the war, with the relocation of industrial plants to the suburbs and the arrival of labour-saving technologies. Technology affected rural blacks as well. Southern landowners received funds from the government to buy machinery like cotton picking machines, tractors, etc., which reduced the need for black farmworkers. In the mining industry, coal loading machines shrank the number of black miners from 35,000 in the 1940s to 9,000 in the 1960s.</p>
	
			<p>As the United States entered the Cold War shortly after the end of World War II, the fear of communism lead to conservative labour movements and anti-revolution laws.  This made it difficult for African Americans and their white allies to support progressive organizations for civil rights or to express political dissent.  Nevertheless, in the 1950s, organizations such as the National Negro Labor Council (NNLC) and later the American Negro Labor Council (ANLC) were created. Their members organized demonstrations, strikes, and boycotts against discriminating employers and worked to increase the presence of African Americans in leadership positions in the labour movement. After targeting local retailers and food chains, these associations became more militant in the 1960s and focused on larger businesses such as national banks, telephone and electricity companies, construction businesses, and hotels.</p>
			
			<p>Despite the efforts, few gains were made, and the participants in the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom in 1963 demanded the end of discrimination in all corporate and institutional fields, as well as within the labour movement itself.</p>

			<p>The need to build affordable accomodations for veterans after World War II and the Housing Act of 1949 kicked off the "urban renewal" program in the United States, which provided federal funding to cities to acquire "slum" areas for redevelopment. Renewal projects in cities such as New York, Philadelphia, Chicago, and Boston caused the destruction of public homes and the displacement of thousands of black families. Dislodged African Americans had to either move to other (already crowded) public housing or integrate into the new "transition areas," formerly all-white neighbourhoods. This development provoked the roughest episodes of racial violence in the Civil Rights era.</p>
			
			<p>In all-white communities and neighbourhoods, homeowners fiercely opposed the arrival of black tenants, especially in suburban areas where the colour line was still clearly demarcated. Homeowners associations were formed to resist black occupancy by any possible legal means. As African American families exercised their rights and moved in anyway, they faced violent responses from their white neighbours, from threatening phone calls to mobs of several hundreds of people hurling insults, throwing rocks, or even setting fire to their homes.  Thousands of these incidents occurred throughout the 1950s and early 1960s. Riots even erupted in some cities, requiring the intervention of the National Guard and sometimes attracting worldwide attention.</p>
	
			<p>These events increased the importance of fair housing in the campaigns of civil rights organizations. They opposed the displacement of black families and demanded the augmentation of unit rentals to black tenants and the desegregation of all-white neighbourhoods. In cities, African Americans picketed and held sit-ins at the offices of "slum lords" to demand better living conditions. They held sit-outs in front of buildings and even dwell-ins, bringing furniture to an apartment and occupying it for days. In New Haven, when a bill authorizing blacks to move into an all-white neighbourhood was defeated, black activists sat in at the City Hall until the police arrested them.</p>
	
			<p>Despite all these actions, few housing gains were made by African Americans during the Civil Rights Movement. In many cities, urban renewal policies led to the development of new ghettos; for example, the number of blacks living in southern Queens in New York City doubled between 1945 and 1950 and grew another 125% by 1960. The intensity of the hatred and violence faced by blacks when they moved into white neighbourhoods gradually weakened their belief in the efficacy of non-violent direct action, setting the stage for urban rebellions and the rise of more radical civil rights organizations in the mid-1960s.</p>

			<p>In northern and western states, school desegregation campaigns generated intense encounters between African Americans and public authorities during the Civil Rights Movement. Black activists blocked buses carrying African American children to segregated schools; mass marches and school boycotts were organized; sit-ins, study-ins, and even sing-ins were staged at Board of Education offices.</p>
			
			<p>Legal means were also taken to end segregation in schools. The NAACP supported several lawsuits against school boards and the Board of Education, including the landmark case Brown v. Board of Education, which brought down school segregation in 1954. After that ruling, the federal government ordered school boards across the country to implement desegregation plans as soon as possible, but real change was slow to come. Although many school boards complied with the orders, over 3,000 others refused and close to 2.5 million black children stayed enrolled in segregated schools.</p>
	
			<p>One of the most spectacular examples of white resistance took place in Arkansas, where the local governor defied the government and sent the Arkansas National Guard to Central High School in Little Rock to prevent nine black students from entering the school.  Protests were organized by white students, their parents, and town residents. United States President Eisenhower sent in the US Army and federalized the Arkansas National Guard and, in response, public schools in Little Rock were closed down for two years before opening their doors to black children.</p>
	
			<p>Even though police escorts were needed to protect the new students in this case and in other predominantly white institutions, African Americans gradually gained access to all schools in the United States in the years that followed the Brown v. Board of Education decision. The end of the 1896 "separate but equal" ruling was a great victory for the Civil Rights Movement.</p>

			<p>Martin Luther King's education in humanities and theology greatly influenced his literary works. He integrated the teachings of philosophers such as Gandhi and Hegel into his work and, as he was a preacher, it is no surprise that his texts sometimes read like sermons and contain numerous biblical metaphors and allusions.</p>
			
			<p>Although King is sometimes criticized for "relying too heavily on rhetorical flourishes and for not offering concrete solutions to the social, political, and economic problems [he addresses]" (Draper), his contribution to protest literature is outstanding and greatly appreciated.</p>

			<p class="citation">All I know about music is that not many people ever really hear it. And even then, on the rare occasions when something opens within, and the music enters, what we mainly hear, or hear corroborated, are personal, private, vanishing evocations. But the man who creates the music is hearing something else, is dealing with the roar rising from the void and imposing order on it as it hits the air. What is evoked in him, then, is of another order, more terrible because it has no words, and triumphant, too, for that same reason. And his triumph, when he triumphs, is ours.<br />

			<p>James Baldwin was a renowned African American writer and an important spokesperson for civil rights. He is mostly known for his direct style and his writings on racial and sexual identity and the struggle between individuality and intolerance. Religious themes often surface in his writing, particularly redemption, sin, and damnation. He did not write in the typical style of protest fiction popularized by his contemporaries, but rather chose to address complex sociological issues resulting from race relations in the United States.</p>
			
			<p>Many critics agree that Baldwin's writing reached a summit in the late 1950s and early 1960s, at the height of the Civil Rights Movement.  His essay collections on the racial situation in the United States (Notes of a Native Son, Nobody Knows My Name, and The Fire Next Time) earned high praise.</p>
	
			<p>During his long career, Baldwin contributed to a variety of genres, especially novels and essays, but also plays, short stories, and children's books. His main publications are:</p>
			
				<p class="works">Poetry</p>
				
				<ul class="works">

			<p>Michael King, Jr., was born in Atlanta, Georgia, on January 15, 1929. His father, Michael King, Sr., a Baptist preacher, changed their first names Martin Luther after a trip to Germany, to honour the founder of the Protestant church.</p>
			
			<p>Martin Luther King, Jr., attended segregated public schools in Georgia. After graduating from high school when he was 15 years old, he enrolled in Morehouse College, a renowned black institution in Atlanta, where he received a sociology degree in 1948. Then he studied theology for three years at the Crozer Theological Seminary in Chester, Pennsylvania, like his father and grandfather before him. He received his degree from Crozer in 1951, as well as a scholarship that he used to enrol in graduate studies at Boston University. There he studied systematic theology and received his Ph.D. in 1955.</p>
	
			<p>The previous year, at the age of 25, King had become the pastor of the Dexter Avenue Baptist Church in Montgomery, Alabama, and the president of the new Montgomery Improvement Association, a civil rights organization. From 1955 to 1956, King led the black community's Montgomery Bus Boycott after the arrest of Rosa Parks, a black woman who had refused to give up her bus seat to a white passenger. During the boycott, King faced charges of conspiracy against the bus company and his house was firebombed. Nevertheless, the action was a success (segregation on city buses was declared unconstitutional in 1956), and King became a national icon of the Civil Rights Movement.</p>
	
			<p>In 1957, King and other African American clergymen and civil rights leaders founded the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC), a regional organization that encouraged African Americans to reject discrimination "absolutely and non-violently." The SCLC worked with local community organizations to campaign against segregation. The strategy adopted was inspired by Christian philosophy and the teachings of Indian leader Mahatma Ghandhi: non-violent direct action in the form of various protest activties across the South. King's engagement in the movement angered the southern authorities and earned him multiple stays in jail.</p>
			
			<p>In 1959, King returned to Atlanta and with his father became co-pastor of the Ebenezer Baptist Church. In the early 1960s, his speeches and involvement in major civil rights demonstrations made him the most powerful representative of the African American struggle against racism in the United States. According to experts, John F. Kennedy's sympathy toward King was a major factor in bringing black votes back to the Democratic Party.</p>
			
			<p>King's popularity reached new heights on August 28, 1963, at the March on Washington, during which he delivered his memorable speech "I Have A Dream" in front of over 250,000 people. His fame spread internationally. That same year, Time magazine named him Man of the Year, and a year later, he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. In 1965, the Selma to Montgomery marches he participated in had a great influence on the passing of the Voting Rights Act later that year.</p>
			
			<p>Despite his status and his political achievement, King faced opposition, even from within the Civil Rights Movement. In the mid-1960s, many blacks thought he was too moderate and turned to the more radical strategies advocated by the Black Power Movement and personalities such as Malcolm X and Stokely Carmichael. Also, King's criticism of American involvement in the Vietnam war made him lose the support of the government and many white liberals. As violent interracial conflicts increased in the country, he became a target of FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover, who attempted to discredit him and kept him under constant surveillance.</p>
			
			<p>On April 4, 1968, King was assassinated by gunshot while addressing the crowd during a local sanitation workers' strike in Memphis, Tennesee. James Earl Ray was convicted of the murder, but the case remained a source of controversy for the following decades.</p>
			
			<p>Martin Luther King, Jr., is recognized as an outstanding speaker for the Civil Rights Movement but also as a prolific writer. In 1986, his birthday was declared a national holiday in the United States. It is celebrated on the third Monday in January.</p>

			<p>James Arthur Baldwin was born in Harlem, New York, on August 2, 1924. His mother, Emma Burdis Jones, was a single woman at the time. Three years later, she married preacher and factory worker David Baldwin. The authoritarian man adopted James, but never showed him love or recognized his precocious talent in writing.   James grew up in a strictly religious and extremely poor household, where he had to take care of his eight younger siblings. He escaped in reading and slipped out when he could to go to movies and plays.</p>
			
			<p>In high school, James Baldwin published articles in the school newspaper and found support for his writing at the literary club. At the age of 13, he knew he wanted to become a writer. He continued publishing after high school, writing book reviews for magazines and pieces on "the Negro problem." A commissioned essay on black anti-semitism ("The Harlem Ghetto") launched Baldwin's career and earned him invitations from numerous publications. At that time, Baldwin met Richard Wright, a famous African American writer, who became his mentor.  Wright helped Baldwin secure a fellowship to write his first novel, Go Tell It on the Mountain, a semi-autobiographical story that would later be recognized as one of his best works.</p>
	
			<p>In 1948, discouraged by the persistent racism and homophobia in the United States (Baldwin became aware of his homosexuality as a teenager), James Baldwin decided to move to Paris, France, following his mentor who had left the year before. Richard Wright introduced him to local editors, and Baldwin soon published one of his most famous essays, "Everybody's Protest Novel" (1949). The piece established him as a major American writer, but severed his relationship with Wright: it showed the limits and excesses of ideological  fiction and used one of Wright's works (Native Son) as an example.</p>
	
			<p>In the 1950s and early 1960s, James Baldwin wrote passionate essays on race relations in which he bluntly criticized American democracy and exposed the injustice faced by African Americans. After seeing how blacks were still violently discriminated against after the desegregation of schools in the United States, Baldwin decided to end his exile and return home in 1957 to join the Civil Rights Movement. He travelled to the South and soon became a major spokesperson for the struggle of African Americans.</p>
			
			<p>The murder of three of Baldwin's friends, civil rights leaders Medgar Evers, Martin Luther King, Jr., and Malcolm X, deeply affected him and motivated his return to France in the early 1970s. In the late 1970s to mid-1980s, he travelled frequently between Paris and the United States to lecture and teach at various universities. He continued writing, and in 1986, he was given the Legion of Honour, one of the most prestigious decorations in France. He died from stomach cancer in Saint-Paul-de-Vence on November 30, 1987, and was buried in Harlem.</p>

		<h2>The Battle for Equal Rights</h2>
			
			<p>One hundred years after the end of the Civil War, the time had come for African Americans to take a stand against injustice. During the Civil Rights Movement, black leaders set the tone for a major shift in American thinking. Read about some of these initiatives in the cards below.</p>

			<p>During World War II, African Americans continued fighting for their civil rights. They took legal action against various institutions to demand equal treatment, including voting registrars and school boards. The NAACP supported many of these lawsuits and gained popularity: after the war, the organization's membership rose from 50,000 to about 500,000. In the years that followed the end of the war, the campaign for civil rights gained momentum and landmark decisions were made in courts across the country in favour of African Americans.</p>
			
			<p class="actions">Desegregation of the Army</p>
	
			<p>In 1948, President Harry S. Truman bypassed Congress and used Executive Order 9981 to force the integration of the armed forces shortly after World War II. The Army officially desegregated only in 1951, after integrated units proved their value during the Korean War (1950–1953).</p>
	
			<p class="actions">Desegregation of Schools</p>
			
			<p>After the US Supreme Court declared in Brown v. Board of Education (1954) that segregation in public schools was unconstitutional, the government ordered the implementation of desegregation plans in all schoolboards. While some speedily abided by the court order, other schools were slow in implementing change. Many schools resisted by closing down, while newly enrolled black students sometimes had to go to school under police escort for protection. Nevertheless, in the years that followed, all schools became accessible to African Americans.</p>
			
			<p class="actions">Civil Rights Acts</p>
			
			<p>Two Civil Rights Acts had been passed before (in 1957 and 1960), but  one of the most important pieces of legislature in the United States was enacted on the second of July, 1964. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 had been initiated by John F. Kennedy before his death in 1963. It outlawed racial segregation in schools, public places, and employment. The bill was amended at the last minute to include a passage that protected women's rights.</p>
			
			<p class="actions">Voting Rights Act</p>
			
			<p>Many southern states had laws that required people to take a literacy test in order to vote or to be recommended by someone who was already registered.</p>
			
			<p>To protest such discrimination, black activists from Selma, Alabama, organized a march to the state capital, Montgomery, to demand equal voting rights. In Selma, the event was interrupted by the local white police, who dispersed the marchers with such violence that the event made headlines across the nation and led President Johnson and Congress to pass a strong federal voting rights law. The Voting Rights Act of 1965 banned all kinds of racial discrimination in voting and gave any citizen the right to sue in federal court to stop discriminatory practices. Its impact was dramatic: in Mississippi, the percentage of registered black voters increased from 7% in 1964 to 59% in 1968.</p>

			<p>In his "Letter from Birmingham Jail," Martin Luther King, Jr., explains that "Nonviolent direct action seeks to create such a crisis and foster such a tension that a community which has constantly refused to negotiate is forced to confront the issue. It seeks to so dramatize the issue that it can no longer be ignored" (King n. pag.).</p>
			
			<p>In the 1950s, civil rights activists embraced non-violent direct action, even though they faced brutality, violence, and arrest. In areas where people resisted legal decisions and continued to harass African Americans, it became a powerful counter-manoeuvre that dealt a severe blow to the pervasive racism of the United States.  In addition to mass demonstrations, it included boycotts, sit-ins, and other original ways of protesting discrimination.</p>
	
			<p class="actions">Boycotts</p>
	
			<p>Boycotts were often used against businesses that would not hire black employees or serve black customers. These could be extremely powerful if the economic impact was significant enough.</p>
			
			<p>In December 1955, a black woman named Rosa Parks refused to give up her seat to a white man on a city bus in Montgomery, Alabama. Parks was arrested, and the local NAACP chapter called for a boycott of the city’s public transit. They formed the Montgomery Improvement Association and asked Martin Luther King, Jr., a young local minister, to be their spokesperson. The boycott lasted over a year, undermining the profits of Montgomery's public transit corporation and leading the Supreme Court to declare Alabama's laws on segregated buses unconstitutional.</p>
			
			<p>That event was one of the first victories of the Civil Rights Movement, and it revealed Martin Luther King, Jr., as one of its great leaders. The leaders of the Montgomery Improvement Association used their influence to “boost morale for the struggle” (Trotter 526), and other black leaders, such as Reverend T.J. Jenison, developed strategies that served as the blueprint for future boycotts in the southern United States.</p>
			
			<p class="actions">Sit-ins</p>
			
			<p>In February 1960, four African American college students sat at the “whites-only” lunch counter in the Woolworth store of Greensboro, North Carolina. The manager told his staff to ignore them, so the sit-in continued. The next day, the students came back, along with 27 other black people. They all took their seats and waited to be served.  The following days, dozens of people joined the protesters: close to 300 in five days. When the reactions of white people grew too violent, the protesters left and the store closed for days.</p>
			
			<p>The event made the headlines and protests spread quickly. During that year, "75,000 students—both black and white—staged sit-ins in 75 localities. Over 5,600 protesters were arrested, 2,000 of them for picketing outside Northern stores that had segregated Southern branches" ("African American History" n. pag.).</p>
			
			<p class="actions">Freedom Rides</p>
			
			<p>In May 1961, SNCC and CORE members organized what became known as the Freedom Rides. Black and white "freedom riders" took bus trips throughout the South to test compliance with a Supreme Court ruling that prohibited segregation in facilities for interstate travel.</p>
			
			<p>Along the way, the freedom riders encountered violent resistance from whites; many riders were injured, sometimes critically. The events received national attention, and the federal government had to intervene to protect the riders, as Alabama authorities did nothing to prevent the violence. The protest ended when the riders were finally arrested and imprisoned in Mississippi.</p>
			
			<p>Although few bus stations and buses were desegragated immediately after the Freedom Rides, the events clearly demonstrated the conviction and persistence of civil rights activists.</p>

			<p>The mass movement launched by African Americans after World War II in order to regain the rights lost at the beginning of the 20th century shared many similarities with the Reconstruction Period that followed the American Civil War. For that reason, the Civil Rights Movement also became known as the Second Reconstruction.</p>
			
			<p>During that period, many organizations were created to coordinate the increasing number of protests against discrimination in all spheres of American society. The following three are among the most important:</p>
	
			<p class="actions">1. Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) </p>
	
			<p>CORE was founded in 1942 by an interracial group of students from Chicago as "a pacifist organization seeking to change racist attitudes" ("History of CORE" n. pag.). An outgrowth of the Gandhi-inspired organization Fellowship of Reconciliation, this mostly white middle-class organization specialized in non-violent action, particularly sit-ins, jail-ins, and freedom rides. After expanding its focus to include the South, it became involved in some of the Civil Rights Movement’s most important events, such as the Montgomery Bus Boycott, the Freedom Rides, and the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom. CORE still exists today and has its headquarters in New York City.</p>
			
			<p class="actions">2. Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC)</p>
	
			<p>In 1957, after the successful Montgomery Bus Boycott led by Martin Luther King, Jr., a group of ministers led by King  formed the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) to continue organizing non-violent actions against southern segregation. The organization helped coordinate sit-ins and voter registration drives, as well as major events such as the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom and the Selma to Montgomery marches. The SCLC still exists today and has its headquarters in Atlanta, Georgia.</p>
			
			<p class="actions">3. Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC)</p>
	
			<p>In 1960, the SCLC Executive Secretary met with student leaders to try to coordinate local demonstrations and establish a relationship with the students. The students formed a separate organization, the SNCC, with its own leadership. The SNCC first adopted the commitment to non-violence and worked with other organizations to plan major civil rights events. In the later 1960s, as it grew closer to the Black Power and anti-Vietnam War movements, the SNCC felt the need for more radical actions and could no longer guarantee it would restrict itself to non-violent actions. It finally changed its name in 1969 to the Student National Coordinating Committee to reflect its change of mentality, but then disbanded a few years later.</p>
			
			<p class="actions">Political Representation</p>
	
			<p>Although these new organizations did not always agree with each other or with long-established civil rights groups like the NAACP or the National Urban League, their joint efforts certainly contributed to better political representation for African Americans. For example, in 1964, the SNCC and CORE united in massive campaigns for black voter registration during what would later be called the Freedom Summer. They also sent delegates to the National Convention of the Democatic Party in an attempt to unseat the all-white delegation of Mississippi.</p>
			
			<p>By organizing at the state and local level and by forming coalitions within the Democratic Party, the black community gained better political representation. There were nine African Americans in Congress by 1968, (including the first black woman), and their numbers kept growing. In 1971, 21 black congressmen and congresswomen formed the Congressional Black Caucus to represent the interests of African Americans in federal affairs.</p>

		<div class="content-text-container right">
		
			<p>The 1963 March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom was organized by A. Philip Randolph (president of the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters, president of the Negro American Labor Council, and vice president of the AFL-CIO), James Farmer (president of the Congress of Racial Equality), John Lewis (president of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee), Martin Luther King, Jr., (president of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference), Roy Wilkins (president of the NAACP), and Whitney Young (president of the National Urban League). Bayard Rustin, a civil rights veteran, was in charge of the logistics of the march.</p>
			
			<p>Each association had its own objective for the march.  Randolph, King, and the SCLC wanted to increase public awareness of civil rights and employment issues. The SNCC and CORE agreed with Randolph and King's objective, but also intended to protest against the government's collaboration with the segregationist South and its inaction on various civil rights issues. For the NAACP and Urban League, the purpose of the march was to support the civil rights bill initiated by President John F. Kennedy.</p>
	
			<p>Not all African Americans supported the march. Malcolm X, spokesperson for the Nation of Islam, called it the "farce on Washington." Many were afraid that if it turned violent, it would be harmful to the image of the Civil Rights Movement and ruin the efforts put into political and legal actions against discrimination.</p>
	
			<p>Nevertheless, on August 28, 1963, approximately 250,000 demonstrators marched from the Washington Monument to the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, DC. Several renowned speakers addressed the crowd at the Lincoln Memorial, including Martin Luther King, Jr., who gave his memorable "I Have A Dream" speech.</p>
			
			<p>The event called the nation's attention to the injustice and inequalities that black Americans faced because of the colour of their skin. A year later, Congress passed the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which "made segregation in public places illegal, required employers to provide equal employment opportunities, and protected the right to vote of every American, regardless of the color of their skin" (Nammour n. pag.).</p>

			<p>When the United States entered World War II in 1941, African Americans did not simply participate in the war effort because they believed in the cause. They were active in trying to fight abroad but also in fighting for their rights at home, in the army. Whites had their V campaign (V for Victory), but blacks had a double V campaign: Victory against fascism overseas and Victory against racism at home.</p>
			
			<p>As they had done during the previous wars, African Americans continued to deal with white resistance, discrimination, and segregation, yet they enrolled in higher numbers than before. The number of blacks selected for military service increased from 2,069 in 1940 to about 370,000 in 1942 and up to one million by the end of the war, three-quarters of these men being in the armed forces.</p>
	
			<p>During their training at home in military schools, African Americans faced segregation (in parades, church services, transportation, and canteens) as well as bitter and severe discrimination. In the South, there were shooting attacks of the black barracks at Fort Jackson, homicides at Fort Benning in Georgia, and a civilian police attack on black soldiers at Bastrop, Louisiana. This violence was not only ignored by the authorities, it was also institutionalized. Officers treated blacks more severely and harshly and, at the higher levels, the military court-martialled blacks.</p>
	
			<p>Yet African Americans persisted in their training, struggling hard to access sectors or positions in areas previously closed to them. They did it through various means: they wrote protest letters to the newspapers; they refused to work until their demands were heard. African Americans were more numerous and more assertive. They fought the legal system, as well. For example, many blacks were court-martialled for failing to obey orders which whites wouldn't follow. Some were still in court in the 1990s fighting over their refusal to be drafted by a segregationist army back in the 1940s.</p>
			
			<p>In the end, the African American resistance paid off. Some trainees became officers and specialists in training schools, a first in the military. Nearly 125,000 African Americans went overseas, and famous segregated units, such as the Tuskegee Airmen, the 761st Tank Batallion, and the crew of the USS Mason, proved their value in combat. Manual labour paid off as well. In the Pacific, black labourers cleared the jungle and built roads like the Leda Road leading to China. In Europe, they supplied the Allied ground forces in the Normandy campaign in 1944 and were also in Germany as part of the advance guard that freed the survivors of the Dachau and Buchenwald concentration camps (where 100,000 Jewish people perished). Jewish prisoners even reported that the first faces they saw were black.</p>
			
			<p>Despite their contribution to the war effort, few African Americans received distinctions after the conflict. Many had to wait many years to receive presidential citations and other rewards.</p>
			
			<p> Three years after WWII, in 1948, President Harry S. Truman desegregated the army with Executive Order 9981, against the will of many southern congressmen. Although it was a major advancement in civil rights, the order was only pushed through because Truman bypassed Congress, where it would have been blocked by southern officials. Racial tensions in the South persisted, and many years went by before the army became truly integrated.</p>
