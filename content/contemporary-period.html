			<p>African Americans are the most heavily incarcerated population in the world. Although they make up only 12% of the US population, they account for 50% of prison inmates. About a third of African American men are under the supervision of the criminal justice system, and about 12% of African American men in their 20s and 30s are incarcerated (Oliver n. pag.).</p>
			
			<p>African Americans are imprisoned at least eight times as often as white Americans, while American Indians and Hispanics are imprisoned at two to three times the white-American rate. Asian American incarceration rates are generally lower than white-American rates (Oliver n. pag.).</p>
	
			<p>These huge incarceration rates "are not a legacy of Jim Crow, but are a result of policies implemented since the mid-1970s which created exponential growth in incarceration between 1975 and 2000. This growth was not due to growing crime rates, but to greater use of incarceration for lesser offenses and drug offenses" (Oliver n. pag.). For example, in 1988, the Reagan administration passed a law establishing a mandatory jail sentence for the possession of five grams of crack cocaine, and yet, in 1992, more than 90% of the crack cocaine offenders were African Americans. On the other hand, the possession of five grams of the more expensive powdered cocaine did not lead to any minimum sentence, and offenders could often go free on probation.</p>
	
			<p>High incarceration rates have major social and economic consequences for black communities. They make it harder for young black men who have done wrong to be rehabilitated, find jobs, and reintegrate into society. They also have an impact on black women and children: heavy incarceration rates are one cause of the disproportionally high rate of single-mother households in the African American population.</p>

			<p>In the last quarter of the 20th century, globalization and free-trade agreements contributed to a major deindustrialization process in the United States. Between 1983 and 2007, nearly 14 million jobs were lost through plant closings, technological changes, company movings, etc. ("African American History" n. pag.). Although all Americans were affected by these changes, African Americans particularly suffered from the transition to a knowledge-based and service economy.</p>
			
			<p>The percentage of black men working in industrial jobs dropped from 37% in 1973 to 20% in 1987. These men continued to work, but switched to retail trade and service jobs, where wages were 25% to 30% lower than in industrial jobs  ("African American History" n. pag.). The living conditions of working-class blacks decreased, as the number of African Americans entering middle-class white-collar jobs was not suffficient to compensate for the loss of manufacturing jobs.</p>
	
			<p>By 1990, more than one in every four adult black men between the ages of 24 and 54 were out of work. The rate was much higher for young black men in the inner city, and overall black unemployment was two-and-a-half times higher than white unemployment. In 1983, black unemployment stood at a record high of almost 21%. Correspondingly, the overall black poverty rate rose so high that by 1989 almost one-third of all black Americans were below the poverty line, more than three times the rate for whites ("African American History" n. pag.).</p>
	
			<p>Although the United States Supreme Court  had approved affirmative action programs to help blacks get jobs and promotions and counteract past discrimination by the late 1970s, the more conservative political atmosphere of the 1980s decreased the influence of affirmative action and the protection of civil rights won in the 1960s.</p>
			
			<p>Throughout the 1990s and at the beginning of the 21st century, affirmative action remained one of the most divisive racial issues in the United States. Some people felt it was still necessary to counter past discrimination, while others continued to see it as reverse discrimination and used the language of the Civil Rights Movement to condemn the use of racial or gender preferences.</p>

			<p>Early in the Contemporary Period, middle-class and educated working-class African Americans started benefiting from affirmative action programs and gained access to better jobs. As a result, many fled the poorer central city environments to go to the suburbs. In 1980, 23% of the black population lived in suburban areas, compared to fewer than 10% in the 1960s and 1970s. At the same time, a large number of African Americans moved back to the southern states, where more upper level jobs were available to them. In fact, in 1978, Ebony magazine included five southern cities in its ten best cities for blacks looking for better employment.</p>
			
			<p>As thousands of middle-class blacks sought a better environment in the suburbs or in the South, poor and working-class blacks faced deteriorating living conditions in northern and western inner cities. In poverty-stricken urban communities, an increasing number of African Americans experienced disproportionately high rates of unemployment, crime, drug use, homelessness, and single-mother households. The proportion of blacks living in poor urban ghetto areas rose from 33% in 1970 to 50% in 1990. These conditions had an impact on the health of poor blacks: their life expectancy was approximately five to eight years behind that of their white counterparts.</p>
	
			<p>Public housing projects were the most flagrant examples of the effects of extreme poverty. In the Robert Taylor Homes in Chicago, 90% of families with children were led by women, and 47% of the residents were unemployed. While the project housed only 0.5% of Chicago's population, it accounted for 9% of rapes, 10% of aggravated assaults, and 11% of murders.</p>
	
			<p>In the 1980s, the proportion of homeless black people reached an alarming level: African Americans accounted for 47% of homeless men and women, and 56% of homeless women and children.</p>
			
			<p>Although in recent decades, African American graduation rates and family incomes have improved, a large percentage of the black population still suffers from extreme poverty and dreadful living conditions. These issues have become major targets for African American activists and community leaders.</p>

			<p>Developments in the last decades of the 20th century seemed to justify the title of one of the era’s most influential books, The Declining Significance of Race (1978), by William Julius Wilson. It argued that economic class was beginning to replace race as the determinant of individual opportunity for African Americans. Falling incomes for some blacks accompanied rising financial and professional opportunities for others. At the same time that inner-city residents were facing growing insecurity on the streets and in their homes, black people were becoming more visible and influential in city halls, state houses, and the halls of Congress.</p>
			
			<p>Yet public racial intolerance and shocking acts of racial violence offered disturbing signs that race was still very significant. A young black man was killed in 1986 in Howard Beach, a white residential section of New York City. He was attempting to escape a mob that challenged his right to be there. In a similar incident three years later, a black teenager was killed by a white gang in the Bensonhurst section of Brooklyn. Another divisive issue in the 1980s was white opposition to legislation making the birthday of Martin Luther King, Jr., a national holiday.</p>
	
			<p>In 1991, Rodney King, an African American from Los Angeles, was severely beaten by local police officers for resisting arrest for speeding and drunk driving. The scene was videotaped by a bystander, and portions of the tape were broadcast by news channels worldwide, causing public outrage everywhere. The following year, all police officers involved in the event were acquitted by a jury composed of ten whites, one Asian American and one Latino American. The decision sparked off violent riots in Los Angeles: residents looted and burned buildings and attacked whites trapped in the area.  Approximately fifty people died, more than 2,000 were injured, and property damage was evaluated at $1 billion. In the aftermath of the Los Angeles riots, the local police force was severely blamed, and the four police officers involved in the beating faced a federal grand jury for violating King’s civil rights. The jury was more racially diversified, and its members finally convicted two of the four officers.</p>
	
			<p>In 1994, the O.J. Simpson trial (for the murder of Simpson's ex-wife and her friend), one of the most publicized criminal trials in the history of the United States, also demonstrated that race was still a major factor in public opinion. National surveys showed dramatic differences between most blacks and most whites in terms of their assessment of Simpson's guilt ("Race factor" n. pag.).</p>
			
			<p>Day-to-day discrimination also found its way into the Contemporary Period. The Ku Klux Klan and neo-Nazi organizations underwent a resurgence in the 1980s and 1990s, and were involved in numerous incidents of intimidation and violence against African Americans. On a more scientific basis, conservative intellectuals produced genetic theories to explain racial disparities. For example, in their book The Bell Curve (1994), social theorists Charles Murray and Richard J. Herrenstein argued that African Americans were at the bottom of the political economy because of "inherited racial characteristics," in addition to cultural factors (Trotter 614–615).</p>
			
			<p>Although African Americans have greatly narrowed the gap with whites in many areas, such as schooling and married-couple income, race continues to be an issue in American society. Individuals and civil rights organizations still have a lot to do to provide equal opportunities for all.</p>

			<p>The African American community has often been divided on the ways to improve its living conditions and claim its civil rights. The diversification of African American identities and social classes during the Contemporary Period adds new challenges to the black population's search for solidarity.</p>
			
			<p>In the 1980s, the voice of black conservatives emerged on the political scene,  personified by many influential African American economists and politicians. Like their white counterparts, black conservatives advocated a reduction of the welfare system, arguing that it keeps African American families in poverty. They also spoke against affirmative action, saying it goes against the idea of the "colour-blind" society promoted by the Civil Rights Movement.</p>
	
			<p>Many poor and working-class African Americans were disappointed by the black conservatives and by elected black officials in general, who often turned away from them by cutting social programs and making alliances with corporate leaders. This disenchantment combined with poverty made many African Americans in need resort to crime and violence.</p>
	
			<p>The gap between poor blacks and middle-class blacks became wider as the middle class grew. In 1995, 36% of African Americans were in the middle class, compared to 30% below the poverty line (Trotter 637). This can be explained by the fact that more African Americans completed college degrees over the years (13% of blacks had a college degree in 1995, compared to 1.5% in the early 1950s) (Trotter 637). As more white-collar jobs became accessible to educated blacks, however, many working-class blacks lost their jobs in the 1990s when corporations were reorganized to face globalization.</p>
			
			<p>In addition to economic consequences, these losses also had effects on gender relations in the African American community. Based on the white American society model, black men were in charge of most black families and organizations, and black women had largely accepted this. But as a large number black men faced unemployment and lost the position of provider in the household, black women gained access to education and better paying jobs. This change in roles created conflicts between black women, who no longer wished to put up with sexism, and black men, who needed to find other ways of expressing their masculinity.</p>
			
			<p>Homosexuality is also a contemporary issue for African Americans. For many years, black gay and lesbian activists have denounced the homophobic attitudes of  many groups within the black community, such as conservative associations and certain hip hop artists.</p>
			
			<p>Like white Americans, African Americans of the Contemporary Period face their own internal divisions between rich and poor, men and women, heterosexuals and homosexuals, etc. The main challenge stays the same: to overcome these disagreements in order to allow the black community to unite behind the ongoing struggle for equal rights and opportunities.</p>

			<p class="citation">Still I Rise<br />
<br />
You may write me down in history<br />
With your bitter, twisted lies,<br />
You may trod me in the very dirt<br />
But still, like dust, I'll rise.<br />
<br />
Does my sassiness upset you?<br />
Why are you beset with gloom?<br />
'Cause I walk like I've got oil wells<br />
Pumping in my living room.<br />
<br />
Just like moons and like suns,<br />
With the certainty of tides,<br />
Just like hopes springing high,<br />
Still I'll rise.<br />
<br />
Did you want to see me broken?<br />
Bowed head and lowered eyes?<br />
Shoulders falling down like teardrops.<br />
Weakened by my soulful cries.<br />
<br />
Does my haughtiness offend you?<br />
Don't you take it awful hard<br />
'Cause I laugh like I've got gold mines<br />
Diggin' in my own back yard.<br />
<br />
You may shoot me with your words,<br />
You may cut me with your eyes,<br />
You may kill me with your hatefulness,<br />
But still, like air, I'll rise.<br />
<br />
Does my sexiness upset you?<br />
Does it come as a surprise<br />
That I dance like I've got diamonds<br />
At the meeting of my thighs?<br />
<br />
Out of the huts of history's shame<br />
I rise<br />
Up from a past that's rooted in pain<br />
I rise<br />
I'm a black ocean, leaping and wide,<br />
Welling and swelling I bear in the tide.<br />
Leaving behind nights of terror and fear<br />
I rise<br />
Into a daybreak that's wondrously clear<br />
I rise<br />
Bringing the gifts that my ancestors gave,<br />
I am the dream and the hope of the slave.<br />
I rise<br />
I rise<br />
I rise.<br />

			<p class="citation">Bounty Supermarket was on Venice Boulevard, miles and miles from Socrates' home. He gaped at the glittering palace as he strode across the hot asphalt parking lot. The front wall was made from immense glass panes with steel framing to hold them in place. Through the big windows he could see long lines of customers with baskets full of food. He imagined apples and T-bone steaks, fat hams and the extra-large boxes of cereal that they only sold in supermarkets.<br />
<br />
The checkers were all young women, some of them girls. Most were black. Black women, black girls—taking money and talking back and forth between themselves as they worked; running the packages of food over the computer eye that rang in the price and added it to the total without them having to think a thing. <br />
<br />
In between the checkout, black boys and brown ones loaded up bags for the customers.<br />

Socrates walked up to the double glass doors and they slid open moaning some deep machine blues.<br />

			<p>Walter Mosley is considered one of the leading American novelists, especially in the genre of crime fiction. His most popular work is certainly the historical mystery series featuring the hard-boiled detective Easy Rawlins, a black private investigator and World War II veteran living in the Watts neighbourhood of Los Angeles.</p>
			
			<p>The most important aspect of Mosley's fiction is his characters, who must deal with their personal demons in addition to those they encounter. Easy Rawlins and Socrates Fortlow challenge their own conception of good and evil to act in a society where they are discriminated against and often denied justice. Without being protest fiction, Mosley's novels candidly depict racism in various periods of American history.</p>

			<p class="citation">I will wait for her in the yard that Maggie and I made so clean and wavy yesterday afternoon. A yard like this is more comfortable than most people know. It is not just a yard. It is like an extended living room. When the hard clay is swept clean as a floor and the fine sand around the edges lined with tiny, irregular grooves, anyone can come and sit and look up into the elm tree and wait for the breezes that never come inside the house.<br />
<br />
Maggie will be nervous until after her sister goes: she will stand hopelessly in corners, homely and ashamed of the burn scars down her arms and legs, eyeing her sister with a mixture of envy and awe. She thinks her sister has held life always in the palm of one hand, that 'no' is a word the world never learned to say to her.<br />

			<p>Hip hop is a cultural movement made up of four main elements: emceeing (rapping), deejaying, graffiti, and breakdancing. As hip hop became a major phenomenon, it gradually included more components, such as clothing trends and slang.</p>
			
			<p class="works">The Origin of Rap</p>
	
			<p>Rap and rapping refer to the rhythmic delivery of spoken or semi-sung lyrics. In English slang, "to rap" sometimes means "to talk or discuss" ("Rap" n. pag.), a use that was popularized in the mid-1960s in African American English.</p>
	
			<p>Rap was deeply influenced by the black oral tradition. The technique of rhythmic rhyming can be traced back to early African traditions, such as tribal chants and griot performances. The semi-sung style and eloquence of certain rappers can also be found in many black preachers' sermons and speeches. More recent influences on rap include the African American verbal insult game known as "the dozens" and the Jamaican practice of "toasting" (DJs rhyming over sound systems).</p>
			
			<p>Today, rap is so closely associated with hip hop music that the terms are often used interchangeably.</p>
			
			<p class="works">Origins of Hip Hop</p>
			
			<p>The concept of an MC (master of ceremonies) motivating the crowd with stylized talk while a DJ (disc jockey) spins records on the turntable originates in the 1970s disco clubs. The people who went to clubs preferred to dance, however, and were generally not interested in that type of performance. Therefore, the MCs and DJs moved their art outside the discos and performed in public places, especially in large neighbourhood gatherings called "block parties."</p>
			
			<p>Hip hop as we know it was allegedly created in New York in 1973, when a Jamaican-born DJ named Clive Campbell, also known as Kool Herc, launched his career by deejaying his sister's birthday party in the Bronx. Kool Herc's style included reciting rhymes over music and rapping with the microphone. Other block party DJs soon adopted that style and the trend spread to Brooklyn and Manhattan. Like all music, hip hop was influenced by previous genres: the stylized lyrics of blues and R&B, the heavy beat of funk, as well as the improvisation and scat singing of jazz can all be found in hip hop.</p>
			
			<p>For several years, there were no commercial recordings of hip hop music because large record companies were not interested in the genre. Followers had to attend shows and parties and pass homemade recordings of performances from hand to hand, which turned hip hop into a street culture. Record producers finally realized the commercial potential of hip hop and approached MCs and DJs. The single "Rapper’s Delight" by the Sugarhill Gang was the first hip hop hit in 1979. It reached number 36 on the Billboard charts and contributed to the spread of the genre nationwide and worldwide.</p>
			
			<p class="works">The 1980s</p>
			
			<p>Throughout the1980s, New York was the centre of hip hop culture. The art of deejaying was revolutionized by artists such as Kool Herc, Grandmaster Flash, and his companion Grand Wizard Theodore, who introduced many turntable techniques such as "backspinning" and "scratching." Classic hip hop songs and albums were created in New York as well: DJ Afrika Bambaataa's single "Planet Rock" (1982), Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five's hit "The Message" (1982), and Run-DMC's eponymous album (1984) were among the most influential works of the genre.</p>
			
			<p>The popularity of videoclips and the MTV television channel in the late 1980s brought national attention to New York rappers like L.L. Cool J., Big Daddy Kane, Kool Moe Dee, and Rakim. Although the hip hop scene was essentially occupied by black men, women such as rapper Queen Latifah, the duo Salt-N-Pepa, and the all-white group The Beastie Boys became famous during those years.</p>
			
			<p>Many hip hop artists of that period were influenced by Black Nationalism, which showed in their choice of traditional African clothing and hairstyles: blousy pants, brimless round caps ("kufis"), dreadlocks, and a predominance of black, red, and green fabrics.</p>
			
			<p class="works">The 1990s</p>
			
			<p>In the 1990s, New York lost its high ground as other hip hop scenes developed in cities such as Los Angeles and Oakland in California. Feuds between Los Angeles and New York hip hop artists, as well as violent incidents involving rappers (like the murders of The Notorious B.I.G. and Tupak Shakur) received extensive media coverage at the time.</p>
			
			<p>Several major hip hop stars emerged in the 1990s, including Sean "Puff Daddy" Combs (later known as P. Diddy), Jay-Z, and Wyclef Jean (with The Fugees). At the same time, renowned hard rock, pop, and even heavy metal artists started integrating hip hop into their material.</p>
			
			<p>Hip hop also started to have a significant influence on the fashion world. Certain established sportswear and fashion brands had always been attached to the hip hop scene, but in the 1990s, many hip hop artists and executives started their own fashion labels and clothing lines.</p>
			
			<p class="works">Today</p>
			
			<p>Hip hop and its subgenres can now be heard around the world in many languages. Hip hop fashion is worn by many young people everywhere, regardless of race or culture. In the United States, many new stars of the genre have emerged, including Eminem, Lil Wayne, Kanye West, and Snoop Dogg.</p>
			
			<p>The transition from street culture to mainstream did bring to light certain controversies, however. Even within the hip hop circle, some people criticize the questionable lyrics of certain songs, the materialistic attitudes of some hip hop stars, and the excessive commercialization of the genre.</p>
			
			<p>Nevertheless, the popularity of hip hop today demonstrates both the durability and the renewal capacity of the black vernacular tradition. It also reinforces the major African American contribution to the world of music.</p>

		<h2>Heritage and Opportunity</h2>
		
		<p>With the burgeoning of black subcultures in the United States, defining African American identity has become increasingly difficult. When you read the following biographies of important figures in the Contemporary Period, you will notice some of them are either of mixed heritage or were born outside of the United States. They all managed to make the most of  the opportunities generated by African American victories in the 1960s and 70s, however, and like many of their predecessors, they are not afraid to address political and social matters in their work.</p>

			<p>Maya Angelou was born Marguerite Johnson in St. Louis, Missouri, on April 4, 1928. After her parents' divorce, she and her brother Bailey were sent back and forth between their mother in St. Louis and their grandmother in Stamps, Arkansas. The ten years spent with her grandmother in the rural pre-civil rights South had a major impact on Angelou's life and writings. She witnessed the challenges experienced by the African American community, but also the dignity and mutual support that rural blacks extended to one another during the Great Depression.</p>
			
			<p>Angelou also had to face her own difficulties. At the age of eight, during one of her stays in St. Louis, she was raped by her mother's boyfriend. She denounced her assaillant, but had to endure the trial and the subsequent murder of her rapist by her uncles. Convinced that her words had the power to kill, she moved back with her grandmother and refused to speak for approximately five years. Reading and writing became her way to overcome the trauma.</p>
	
			<p>When she finished high school at 16 years of age, Angelou gave birth to a son. A single mother, she took on a variety of odd jobs. She worked as a waitress and a cook, but also flirted with prostitution and drugs. She even became San Francisco's first black female streetcar conductor. She finally decided to study dance and drama and went on to a career in the performing arts. She changed her professional name to "Maya Angelou" when her managers at a San Francisco nightclub suggested that she adopt a "more theatrical" name for her performances. She danced and sang in several shows and joined the cast of the opera Porgy and Bess, touring across Europe.</p>
	
			<p>In the late 1950s, Angelou moved to Brooklyn to focus on her writing. She joined the Harlem Writers Guild, where she met a number of important African American authors, including her friend and mentor James Baldwin. In 1960,  she met civil rights leader Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., and decided to join the Civil Rights Movement. King named her Northern Coordinator of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference.</p>
			
			<p>Shortly afterward, Angelou moved to Africa with her new husband, a South African Freedom Fighter. She spent time in Egypt and Ghana, where she worked as a newspaper editor and a teacher. In Ghana, she met Malcolm X and the two became friends. In 1964, she returned to the United States to help Malcolm X build a new civil rights organization, the Organization of African American Unity, but he was assassinated shortly afterward. Angelou lost another friend a few years later: in 1968, Martin Luther King, Jr.,  was shot on her birthday (April 4). To deal with her grief, she wrote her first autobiography I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings.  Published in 1969, it won her international acclaim. The work exposed the consequences of racism through her personal life as a poor black woman. At the time, making private traumas like rape or psychological violence public was innovative, but very controversial.</p>
			
			<p>Maya Angelou's works have been rewarded many times. In addition to multiple awards, she received a National Book Award nomination in 1970 for I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings and a Pulitzer Prize nomination in 1972 for her poetry collection Just Give Me a Cool Drink of Water 'Fore I Diiie. Angelou also won a Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word or Non-Traditional Album in 1994, for the recording of  "On The Pulse of the Morning," a poem she wrote at the request of President Bill Clinton and delivered at his inauguration.</p>
			
			<p>Angelou also wrote for television and was the first black woman director in Hollywood. She wrote and produced several prize-winning documentaries. An accomplished actress as well, she was nominated for a Tony Award twice: once for her first appearance on Broadway in 1973 and again for her performance in the mini-series Roots in 1977.</p>
			
			<p>Angelou has taught at several American colleges and universities. Since 1981, she has been Reynolds Professor of American Studies and writer-in-residence at Wake Forest University in North Carolina.</p>

			<p>Joseph Saddler was born January 1, 1958, in Bridgetown, Barbados, and grew up in the Bronx (New York). After finishing high school in a vocational establishment where he learned to repair electronics, Saddler started spinning records for free at block parties in his neighbourhood. His turntable tricks and rapid hand movements earned him the nickname Flash. To make his performances more entertaining, Flash invited his friend Keith Wiggins, later known as Cowboy, to rap lyrics over his music.</p>
			
			<p>In the mid-1970s, friends Grandmaster Melle Mel (Melvin Glover) and Kid Creole (Nathaniel Glover) joined with Flash and Wiggins to form Grandmaster Flash and the Three MCs. Two more rappers, Kurtis Blow (Kurt Walker) and Duke Bootee (Ed Fletcher) joined and were later replaced by Rahiem (Guy Todd Williams) and Scorpio (Eddie Norris, aka Mr. Ness). The sextet became known as Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five, one of the first rap groups. The crew was known for its choreographies, studded leather stage wear, and solid rapping skills.</p>
	
			<p>The group recorded a number of underground hit singles before signing with Joe Robinson, Jr., for his Sugar Hill record label. Robinson's wife, Sylvia, began writing songs for them. The group embarked on the first major tour in rap history and released a succession of singles that reached gold-selling status: "Freedom," "Birthday Party,"  and the innovative "Grandmaster Flash on the Wheels of Steel." The song was the first to incorporate samples; it introduced a new way to record music and demonstrated Flash's unique skills.</p>
	
			<p>In 1982, the group released its first studio album, The Message, co-written by Sylvia Robinson. The record sold a million units within a month of its release, and its title song, "The Message," is widely viewed as one of the most remarkable hip hop songs of all time. Interestingly, most members of the group were not interested in recording the song, and only Furious Five MC Melle Mel and Sugar Hill session musician Ed "Duke Bootee" Fletcher ended up writing it.</p>
			
			<p>In 1983, because of  tensions between Flash and Melle Mel, the group split: Melle Mel, Mr. Ness/Scorpio and Cowboy formed Grandmaster Melle Mel and the Furious Five, while Grandmaster Flash, Kidd Creole, and Raheim started working under the name "Grandmaster Flash." Both groups released records; the original group also reunited for charity before the members went solo at the end of the 1980s.</p>
			
			<p>The achievements of Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five were recently acknowledged by the music industry: the band became the first hip hop group ever inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2007.</p>

			<p>Walter Ellis Mosley was born on January 12, 1952, in Los Angeles, California. He grew up as the only child of an African American father and a Jewish mother—a diverse background that often surfaces in his work. Mosley's father's storytelling talent was also a great inspiration; several of Mosley's books are dedicated to him. There are also many similarities between Mosley's father's background and that of Mosley's main character, Easy Rawlins.</p>
			
			<p>Walter Mosley grew up in the Watts neighbourhood of Los Angeles, a mostly African American residential area that serves as the setting for many of his novels. He was educated in public schools and graduated from Johnston State College in Vermont  in 1977. After college, he worked a number of jobs and moved to New York City in the early 1980s. Mosley worked as a computer programmer for a few years before quitting in order to study writing at the City College of New York (CCNY).</p>
	
			<p>With the help of a teacher’s literary agent, Mosley sold his first book, Devil in a Blue Dress, which was published in 1990. Set in the post-World War II Los Angeles neighbourhood of Watts, the mystery earned strong reviews and was the first in the series of Easy Rawlins novels. Rawlins is an African American soldier who returns from the war, works as a private detective, and often wrestles with issues of race and morality.</p>
	
			<p>In addition to the Easy Rawlins books, Mosley has written other mystery series featuring characters such as Fearless Jones and Leonid McGill. He has also produced other tales of fiction (including stories featuring ex-convict Socrates Fortlow), science-fiction, and nonfiction, and adapted some of his work for film and television.  Mosley's works have received numerous nominations for crime fiction prizes and won several awards, including an O. Henry Award (for best short story), a Grammy, and PEN America’s Lifetime Achievement Award.</p>
			
			<p>In addition to writing full-time, Mosley founded the publishing degree program at the City University of New York (CUNY), the only program of its type in the United States. He also served on the boards of directors of the National Book Awards and the Poetry Society of America and was president of the Mystery Writers of America.</p>

			<p>Barack Hussein Obama was born in Honolulu, Hawaii, on August 4, 1961. His mother, Ann, a white American from Kansas, met his father, Barack, Sr., a foreign student from Kenya, at the University of Hawaii. Obama's parents separated when he was two years old. A few years later, his father moved back to Kenya, and Obama and his mother moved to Jakarta, Indonesia, with her second husband. At the age of 10, Obama came back to Hawaii to live with his maternal grandparents. Although in his immediate family he had little connection to his black origins, he soon started to sense the prejudice and racial divide in the United States.</p>
			
			<p>As a teenager, Barack Obama started exploring his racial identity. After reflecting on his own heritage and reading Malcolm X's autobiography and the works of Langston Hughes, W. E. B. Du Bois, and James Baldwin,, Obama came to identify himself as African American, despite his biracial origins. During the 2007 Democratic Party campaign, he said: “I self-identify as African American—that’s how I’m treated and that’s how I’m viewed. I’m proud of it” ("Obama's Racial Identity" n. pag.).</p>
	
			<p>After completing studies in political science, Obama moved to Chicago in 1985 and began working as a community organizer for a group of churches. Raised in a atheist household, he converted to the Christian faith. In 1988, Obama entered Harvard Law School and became the first African American president of the Harvard Law Review. In 1992, after graduating, he became a professor of constitutional law at the University of Chicago, where he stayed for 12 years. He also started to work as a civil rights lawyer in 1993 at the law firm Miner, Barnhill & Galland, where he met his wife.</p>
	
			<p>In 1996, Obama won a seat in the Illinois state Senate. During his time in the Illinois Senate, Obama was instrumental in his work with both Democrats and Republicans in passing legislation on ethics and health care reform. He was also responsible for legislation aimed at death penalty reform and the mandatory videotaping of homicide interrogations.</p>
			
			<p>In 2004, Obama, a candidate for the US Senate, was the keynote speaker at the Democratic National Convention. While his speech urged the nation to elect John Kerry for President, it was Obama’s story about his family, his political views, and his hope for a better future for America that spurred him into national prominence. With that momentum behind him, Obama won the Illlinois seat in the US Senate over his Republican rival.</p>
			
			<p>In February 2007, Obama announced his candidacy for the 2008 Democratic presidential nomination. The main focus of his campaign was to bring change to Washington and unite the country. He eventually won the nomination for the Democratic Party against Hillary Clinton, and the presidential election later on in 2008. He was sworn in as the first African American president of the United States on January 20, 2009.</p>

			<p>Carlton Ridenhour was born August 1, 1960, in Long Island, New York. After graduating from high school, he went on to study graphic design at Adelphi University in Long Island. He started deejaying at the student radio station WBAU, where he met Hank Shocklee and Bill Stephney, who shared his passion for hip hop and politics. Ridenhour began appearing on Stephney's radio show under the name Chuckie D and rapped lyrics on one of Shocklee's hip hop demo tapes, "Public Enemy No. 1." The song came into the hands of the co-founder of production label Def Jam, who immediately asked "Chuck D" Ridenhour  to sign with him.</p>
			
			<p>Reluctant at first, Chuck D eventually formed Public Enemy in 1982, a hip hop group that focused on innovative sounds and politically and socially committed texts. He recruited DJ Terminator X (Norman Lee Rogers) and Professor Griff (Richard Griffin) as the choreographer for the group's backup dancers. He also asked his old friend William Drayton to join as a fellow rapper. Drayton played the role of Chuck D's comic sidekick under the name Flavor Flav. Chuck D also enlisted his university friends: Shocklee was hired as chief producer and Stephney became the group's publicist.</p>
	
			<p>In 1987, Public Enemy released its first album, Yo! Bum Rush the Show. It went mostly unnoticed by the mainstream, but its "spare beats and powerful rhetoric" were acclaimed by hip hop critics and fans (Erlewine) The group's second album, It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back, was released in 1988 and unanimously hailed as revolutionary by music critics. Public Enemy's exciting music "relied on avant-garde cut-and-paste techniques, unrecognizable samples, piercing sirens, relentless beats, and deep funk" (Erlewine n. pag.) Chuck D's politically charged lyrics and Flavor Flav's humourous raps pinpointed the frustrations and concerns of the African American community and encouraged black pride and self-awareness.</p>
	
			<p>As Public Enemy's star rose, the group started facing controversy over its militant lyrics. The endorsement of Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan in the song "Bring the Noise" and attacks on Elvis Presley and John Wayne in "Fight the Power" (the theme created for Spike Lee's 1989 film Do the Right Thing) earned Public Enemy many detractors. Then Professor Griff's anti-Semitic remarks in an interview he gave to The Washington Post during the summer of 1989 generated such a reaction in public opinion that Chuck D had to ban him from the group. Public Enemy was disbanded shortly after: by the end of 1990, DJ Terminator X had left for a solo career, production members Shocklee and Stephney had gone as well, and Flavor Flav was repeatedly in trouble with the law.</p>
			
			<p>Chuck D retired Public Enemy from touring in 1995 and severed ties with its record label. In 1996, he founded his own hip hop label, created a line of clothing, and released his first solo album, The Autobiography of Mistachuck. The following year he published a book, Fight the Power: Rap, Race and Reality, and reunited the original lineup of Public Enemy to record the soundtrack album to Spike Lee’s 1998 film He Got Game. At the end of the 1990s, Chuck D became a champion of Internet music distribution, even making Public Enemy’s 1999 album There’s a Poison Goin’ On available at a low cost on the Internet. Public Enemy continued releasing albums in the 2000s, including special collaborative projects with other hip hop artists, such as Rebirth of a Nation with rapper Paris.</p>
			
			<p>Despite the controversies, Public Enemy's sound and politically charged lyrics deeply influenced hip hop and made the group one of the most important contributors to the genre.</p>

			<p>Alice Malsenior Walker was born February 9, 1944, in Eatonton, Georgia, the eighth child of a couple of sharecroppers.</p>
			
			<p>When she was eight, one of Walker's brothers accidentally shot her in the eye with an air gun. As a result, she lost sight in her right eye and was temporarily disfigured by the scar tissue that formed over the injury. She became shy and introverted until the scar tissue was removed when she was fourteen.</p>
	
			<p>In 1961, Walker enrolled at Spelman College in Atlanta, Georgia, and became involved in the Civil Rights Movement. She met Martin Luther King, Jr., and attended the famous 1963 March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom. In 1964, Walker transfered to Sarah Lawrence College and dedicated herself to becoming a writer. She became pregnant and, after considering different options (including suicide), chose to abort her pregnancy, although it was illegal at the time. After the event, she began writing her first published short story, “To Hell with Dying," which appeared in The Best Short Stories by Negro Writers edited by Langston Hughes in 1967. She also produced poems on love, civil rights, and suicide that would become part of her first book of poetry, Once, published in 1968.</p>
	
			<p>Alice Walker graduated from Sarah Lawrence College and received her bachelor of arts degree in 1966. After working for the Welfare Department in New York, she moved to Greenwood, Mississippi, and worked for the NAACP Legal Defense Fund. Walker took depositions from blacks who had been evicted from their homes for attempting to register to vote. While there, she met Mel Leventhal, a Jewish civil rights lawyer from New York City. They married in 1967 and later faced death threats by the Ku Klux Klan, as interracial unions were forbidden in Mississippi. In addition to her civil rights activities, Walker worked as a college writer-in-residence and was a black history consultant to the Friends of the Children of Mississippi Head Start program.</p>
			
			<p>In the 1970s, Walker published her first novel, The Third Life of Grange Copeland (1970), which depicted sexist violence and abuse in the African American community. Her second volume of poetry, Revolutionary Petunias and Other Poems (1972), and her first collection of short stories, In Love and Trouble: Stories of Black Woman (1973), feature the lives of southern black peasant women and their "heroic resistance" as guardians of black culture (Gates and McKay 2426). Those volumes and several essays published during that period earned her critical acclaim. After moving to New York, Walker completed Meridian (1976), a novel describing the coming of age of several civil rights workers in the 1960s.</p>
			
			<p>Walker's works of the 1970s focused on the challenges faced by southern African American women of the 1900s. She confronted the black cultural nationalist position of the 1960s, which "idealized black manhood and seldom acknowledged the oppression of women" (Gates and McKay 2426). She joined writer Toni Morrison in beginning what became known as a renaissance of African American women writers. Walker started to use the word "womanism" (derived from the black folk expression "womanish") instead of "feminism," to honour the strength of black women.</p>
			
			<p>In 1982, Alice Walker wrote her most popular novel, The Color Purple (1982). The book was one of the most controversial pieces of African American literature, as it  examined not only “black-on-black” oppression and abusive male-dominated relationships, but also incest, bisexual love, and lesbian love. Despite the critics and the censorship, the book won the National Book Award and the Pulitzer Prize in 1983, making Walker the first black woman to win these awards. A true commercial success, The Color Purple was adapted into a film by Steven Spielberg in 1985 and became a Broadway musical in 2004.</p>
			
			<p>Walker received many other awards for her body of work, as well as honorary degrees. She is active in a number of environmental and human rights causes and is known for endorsing unconventional positions. She continues to write, and she is committed to the recovery and promotion of the works of black women writers.</p>

			<p>Many major cities had their first African American mayor elected at the beginning of the Contemporary Period: Newark (Kenneth Gibson, 1970), Los Angeles (Thomas Bradley, 1973), Atlanta (Maynard Jackson, 1973), Detroit (Coleman Young, 1973), Chicago (Harold Washington, 1983)... Such victories continued in cities across the country throughout the 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s.</p>
	
			<p>Federal politics and the presidency also attracted African Americans during the 1970s. In 1972, Congresswoman Shirley Chislom was the first woman and the first black to seek the presidential nomination of the Democratic Party, but she received little support from white feminists and African Americans, especially men. In 1988, minister and civil rights leader Jesse Jackson also attempted to win the nomination for the Democratic Party. Although he did win Virginia’s Democratic primary and received 6.6 million votes across the country, Jackson did not obtain the nomination. Nevertheless, he became one of the most influential members of the party.</p>
	
			<p>Meanwhile, the number of blacks in Congress also grew. By 1994, there were 40 members in the Congressional Black Caucus, including Carol Moseley Braun, the first black female senator. In 1989, General Colin Powell was appointed chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, becoming the first African American to hold that position. That same year, the first black governor of state, L. Douglas Wilder, was elected in Virginia. Twelve years later, General Powell also became the first black Secretary of State and was succeeded by a black woman, Condoleeza Rice.</p>
			
			<p>Yet one of the most transformative events in African American history was the election of Barack Obama as the first president of black descent in the United States. According to many commentators: "Obama’s victory seemed to signal that race was no longer a major factor weighing against black candidates for high office" (Horton and Horton 30). Obama received 43% of the white vote, 66% of the Hispanic American vote, and 95% of the black vote, and he was very popular among Native Americans. He was also the most popular in all age groups, except for 65 years and over (Horton and Horton 31). In fact, a record number of people attended Obama's inauguration on January 20, 2009, at the National Mall.</p>
			
			<p>It seems that in Barack Obama, African Americans finally found a way to connect "the aging leadership of the Civil Rights Movement and a new generation that acknowledged its debt to the struggles of the 1960s but sought . . . a new outlook on remaining racial challenges (Horton and Horton 31). Although it is too soon to establish the outcome of Obama's presidency, the event certainly marked the beginning of a new era in US race relations.</p>

			<p>In the Contemporary Period, African Americans continued to penetrate and even dominate traditional American sports.</p>
			
			<p>From the end of the 1970s to the late 1990s, a succession of African American champions ruled heavyweight boxing, starting with Muhammad Ali, who won three world championships in a row. All team sports had their African American celebrities as well. In baseball, Reginald "Reggie" Martinez Jackson from the New York Yankees entered the Hall of Fame in 1992. His brilliant career included exploits such as hitting three homeruns in a single World Series game. In basketball, major stars such as Earvin "Magic" Johnson and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar of the Los Angeles Lakers, as well as Michael Jordan of the Chicago Bulls, led their teams to national championships and fascinated crowds nationwide. They also became an image of success for sports-related industries. Michael Jordan was the most sought-after athlete for endorsements in the late 1980s: advertising contracts made him a multi-millionaire, and in 1985, the sportswear company Nike released a shoe named after him (Air Jordan), which generated hundreds of millions of dollars in sales.</p>
	
			<p>As in previous decades, African Americans performed extremely well in track and field events at World Championships and summer Olympic Games. In 1992,  Jackie Joyner-Kersee won the heptathlon at the Olympics in Barcelona, Spain, and was described as "the world's greatest woman athlete" ("Great Olympic Moments" 1). At the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, Michael Johnson set a world record in the 200-metre run and became the first man to win gold medals in the 200-metre and 400-metre races in the same Olympiad.  In recent Olympiads, African Americans have particularly excelled in sprint, relay, and hurdle races, winning dozens of gold medals for the United States.</p>
	
			<p>At the end of the 1990s, African Americans started dominating new areas of sports. In golf, Eldrick "Tiger" Woods was the youngest player and the first African American (and Asian American) to win the prestigious US Masters championship (1997). He won three more tournaments and received the PGA's Player of the Year award. In tennis, sisters Venus and Serena Williams won the doubles title at the US and French Opens in 1999.  The same year, Serena Williams became the first African American to win a Grand Slam title since Althea Gibson in 1958.</p>
			
			<p>At the turn of the 21st century, the number and variety of African American accomplishments in sports show a true social change in that area, as well as an impressive broadening of black sports culture in America.</p>

			<p>When the blaxploitation film trend that depicted blacks in more stereotypical roles began to run out of steam, the film and television industry started to produce serious African American movies and television shows, as well as situational comedies and talk shows. The Cosby Show, a sitcom starring Bill Cosby, became the most popular TV comedy of the late 1980s and early 1990s. Oprah Winfrey started her talk show in 1986 and revolutionized the genre by appealing to her audience's needs. She purchased the rights to all her shows and became a famous producer. She became the first African American billionnaire and one of the most influential people in the entertainment industry.</p>
				
			<p>In films, in addition to mainstream movies starring African Americans (such the Beverly Hills Cop series with Eddy Murphy), Hollywood started releasing important films on African American history and culture, like The Color Purple (1985), Glory (1990) and Amistad (1997). Independent black directors also achieved success, including Spike Lee, with his acclaimed biographical picture Malcolm X in 1992. Black actors such as Morgan Freeman, Will Smith, Halle Berry, and Denzel Washington regularly starred in Hollywood blockbusters, but also portrayed memorable African American characters, real or fictitious, which earned them various awards and nominations.</p>
	
			<p>The music of the Contemporary Period has been deeply imprinted by African American artists. Pop music artists of the late 1970s and the 1980s such as Donna Summers, Tina Turner, Prince, and Whitney Houston rose to international success. Michael Jackson became the "King of Pop" in the 1980s; his unique albums, videos, and dance performances made him one of the most commercially successful and influential entertainers of all time. Another musical current gained appreciation in the 1980s: hip hop went from a street culture to a commercial trend and popularized African American culture and artists worldwide.</p>
			
			<p>In literature, black writers built on the Black Arts movement and focused on the strength of the black community and heritage. Black women authors became a pillar of African American literature: in 1983, The Color Purple by Alice Walker won the Pulitzer Prize for literature as well as the National Book Award, and Toni Morrison became the first African American to win the Nobel Prize for literature.</p>

			<p>In the 1980s and 1990s, poor and working-class blacks, especially women, became the backbone of African American activism. The increasingly difficult living conditions of poor and working-class blacks and the inequalities within the criminal justice system led to the development of numerous grassroots organizations defending welfare rights, social justice, and youth protection. Although there were black professionals and business people involved in the administration of these associations, many leaders came from antipoverty groups that involved mostly poor and working-class black women.</p>
			

			<p>More established groups, like the Nation of Islam, tried to work on the difficulties within the African American community. In 1995, motivated by the increase in the divisions between black men and women, the growing number of poor female-headed households, and the increasing prevalence of drugs and youth violence, Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan organized the Million Man March on Washington (MMM). The goal was to encourage black men to apologize to black women for past abuses and to take charge of their own lives and become "viable providers and defenders of their families and their communities" (Trotter 624). The march brought together various religious and grassroots organizations and ended up being the one of the largest demonstrations in the late 20th century. Although many women participated in the march, its emphasis on black men did raise criticism from feminist groups, as well as from gay and lesbian organizations. Many organized their own events in response to the MMM. The emphasis on self-help and hard work by the MMM movement was also criticized, as it seemed reminiscent of early 1900s philosophies. Nevertheless, the event and its concept influenced many demonstrations in the decade that followed.</p>

			<p>During the same period, major civil rights organizations such as the NAACP, the SCLC, and CORE continued their work to secure the rights and pursue the political and economic empowerment of African Americans and other minorities. Indeed, increasing immigration to the United States over the years has given a multicultural appearance to poverty and social injustice. For example, some people have observed that, unlike the urban violence of the 1960s, the Los Angeles riots of 1992 (caused by the acquittal of four local police officers prosecuted for severely beating an African American man) were in fact a multicultural revolt: 60% of the participants were Latino, 25% black and 13% white (Trotter 627).</p>
	
			<p>In the Contemporary Period, African Americans are no longer alone in their struggle for social justice. They are joined by new communities who face the same conditions that have sparked urban violence for decades: poverty and discrimination.</p>
