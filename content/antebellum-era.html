		<h2>“Been in the Storm So Long”</h2>
			<p>A storm is the metaphor that this African American song title uses to describe the life of black slaves. We can certainly imagine how difficult their existence must have been, especially when we are aware of the abuse many of them suffered. But what was it like on a day-to-day basis?</p>
		
			<p>After all, millions of African Americans spent their lives in bondage and managed to survive. How did they do it?</p>

			<p>In the history of slavery, there were times and places where slaves were treated in a more dignified manner. In Israel, slaves could attain high managerial positions on the estates; in the Aztec Empire, children of slaves were free and mistreated slaves were emancipated.</p>
			
			<p>In America, black slaves were considered racially inferior. Therefore, they were treated as property, and their status as less-evolved people made masters act towards them in a high-handed way that justified harsh punishments.  Although there were laws prohibiting the mistreatment of slaves, white owners were rarely convicted, so beatings and whippings were common practice.</p>
	
			<p>On the plantations, field workers and their families lived in small houses, while the few house slaves got attic or basement rooms in the master's home. According to the law, a master had to provide healthy food, sufficient clothes, and medical attention to his slaves, but owners would usually give the minimum to ensure their workers' survival. The living conditions were often inadequate, and many slaves suffered from respiratory and intestinal diseases.</p>
	
			<p>Slaves who lived in urban locations generally had better living conditions than plantation slaves. If they were skilled, they could be rented by their owners and even hire themselves out to earn money. They could live more comfortably and save to escape or buy their freedom.</p>
			
			<p>Although it seems that slavery was everywhere in America, only roughly 25% of the white population owned slaves, most of them in the South, and the majority had fewer than 20 slaves. The rich and powerful planters were a minority. Most of the white population accepted the institution of slavery, however, and wished they could acquire slaves themselves one day.</p>

			<p>As time passed, African American slaves built families and communities of their own. As their material conditions and social networks improved, so did their means of resisting bondage.</p>
			
			<p>In the fields and factories, slaves slowed down work by damaging and stealing material or pretending to be sick.  They sabotaged production or set fire to crops and buildings. Black overseers feigned whipping the workers, who pretended to suffer and cry.</p>
	
			<p>Slave owners feared being murdered by their bondsmen, which apparently happened frequently. Larger groups of slaves planned revolts and engaged in armed uprisings, leading to more repression and surveillance from the states.</p>
	
			<p>A common act of resistance was escape. Depending on their location, the fugitives tried to go either north (to reach abolitionist states or Canada) or to neighbouring lands free from their owners' control. Runaways used a variety of means to escape, from disguising themselves to hiding in trunks. The Underground Railroad became a well-known escape network, especially in the 19th century. Despite its name, it was neither a railroad nor underground. Its routes were generally travelled on foot by the fugitives, led individually or in small groups by "conductors" between safe houses where they could rest and eat. The Railroad managers were generally free blacks and abolitionists. Once they arrived in a free land, the runaways helped their families escape as well.</p>
			
			<p>Over the course of 200 years, tens of thousands of African American slaves broke away from bondage, the majority heading for Canada and the British Caribbean.</p>

			<p>To face a life of forced labour and abuse, slaves worked hard to build a family and a community. After a day's work, they got together to sing, play music, dance, and tell stories. Those who worked in the master's house shared news or gossip. These occasions were also used to discuss resistance tactics and escape plans.</p>
			
			<p>Marriages between slaves were organized with the owners' approval. Under the influence of the local Christian religion, monogamous unions and nuclear families became standard, although in many cases, husband and wife did not live under the same roof. For that reason and because of their slave status, men were usually powerless to protect their wives against the abuse of white men. The rape of slave women by their masters or overseers and the birth of mixed-race children were common.</p>
	
			<p>Parents taught their children useful skills for work, but also how to act with white people and how to behave to avoid mistreatment. The greatest fear of slave families was sale: as a punishment, owners often sold or permanently hired out workers or their children.</p>
	
			<p>Slave communities also maintained African traditions: dance and music, songs and stories, certain religious customs, and even cooking. Families sometimes grew their own crops, which included indigenous African products such as peanuts, soybeans, okra, and spices.</p>

			<p>New languages developed among African American slaves, mostly combinations of African dialects and colonial language. Some multilingual slaves spoke English, French, Dutch, Arabic, Spanish, and Portuguese. This enabled them to negotiate freedom or gain privileges from slaveholders.</p>
			
			<p>Conscious of that power, slave owners withheld access to language by speaking in codes and preventing slaves from learning to read or write.</p>
	
			<p>This situation contributed to the development of pidgin English among African American slaves, a simplified form of the language combined with other languages that eventually developed into what is known today as African American Vernacular English.</p>
	
			<p>The prohibition to read and write also contributed to the growth of the oral tradition among African Americans. It was used to pass on history, folklore, social and cultural values, a sense of morality, and proper behaviour to younger slaves.</p>
			
			<p>Few slaves had the privilege of having a master generous enough to educate them or the opportunity to secretly learn on their own. Those who did often used their skills to communicate plans for rebellion and escape or to produce literary works promoting the abolition of slavery, like Olaudah Equiano, Frederick Douglass, and others.</p>

			<p>In order to cope with the difficult conditions of bondage, African American slaves turned to religion. Many of them were already Muslims or Christians, but masters and state laws usually forbade them to practise their rituals. Underground churches were created; hidden from their owners, slaves preached and worshipped as they pleased. Elements of African religions such as witchcraft, fortune telling, and conjuring were sometimes integrated into these practices. For example, New Orleans Voodoo originated from the traditions of West African slaves brought to Louisiana in the 18th century.</p>
			
			<p>As Christianity's popularity grew in all of America, many slave owners believed it was safer to evangelize to the slaves and  use religion to justify their status. As more and more African Americans attended Baptist and Methodist churches, they became interested in the Bible. They thought it contained the key to their freedom in the form of messages of equality and promises of life after death.</p>
	
			<p>Because reading was prohibited, many slaves held secret preaching sessions at the end of which they cried out and danced. Singing was also omnipresent in the religious culture: spirituals expressed the cruelty of slavery and the hope of a better existence in Heaven.</p>

			<p>The oral tradition is a fundamental element of African American culture. It includes speeches, sermons, and songs that were designed to entertain and instruct listeners. It is also called the vernacular tradition, which means "native" or "indigenous," because the tradition is inherently African American.</p>
			
			<p>In Africa, the spoken word has been a way to pass on values and culture to younger generations for hundreds of years. In West Africa, the griots—professional storytellers—carried on the oral history through songs and folktales. When African slaves were transported to America across the Atlantic Ocean, they brought that tradition with them.</p>
	
			<p>Since then, the oral tradition has evolved into sophisticated and stylized works. The scope has been broadened to include hip hop and poetry. Landmark speeches and comedy routines have recently been regarded as part of the oral tradition.</p>

		<h2>An Emerging African American Literature</h2>
		
		<p>What could be better than the words of African Americans themselves to describe the struggles of the black community in what would become the United States of America? Long before the abolition of slavery in 1865, African Americans found ways to express themselves: in speech, in music, or even in writing.</p>
		
		<p>While singing spirituals was accessible to most African Americans, reading and writing were a luxury. Nevertheless, among those fortunate enough to achieve a sufficient level of literacy, a small number of talented writers succeeded in publishing their works with the help of white supporters.</p>

			<p>Spirituals are Christian religious songs developed by African American slaves in pre-Civil War America.  Performed during religious services in churches, spirituals could be heard in work and leisure settings as well. They generally feature God, Jesus, and the Old Testament's heroes and prophets; they typically express hope for salvation, divine justice, and an afterlife in Heaven.</p>
			
			<p>Although they were primarily sung to express religious fervour, especially among newly converted Christians, spirituals had other functions. In addition to lifting the spirits of slaves and helping them endure their difficult conditions, spirituals were also a means of communication. For example, songs like "Didn't My Lord Deliver Daniel" denounced the state of bondage of African Americans. Other songs conveyed information about secret meetings and provided guidance to runaway slaves. "Wade in the Water (God's a-Gonna Trouble the Water)" suggested walking in water to avoid being located by dogs, and "Swing Low, Sweet Chariot" referred to the chariots fugitive slaves hid in while escaping on the Underground Railroad.</p>
	
			<p>Today, spirituals are still widely sung, both in their original versions and in new adaptations. For example, many spirituals were rewritten in the gospel style in the early 20th century.</p>

				I was born in Tuckahoe, near Hillsborough, and about twelve miles from Easton, in Talbot county, Maryland. I have no accurate knowledge of my age, never having seen any authentic record containing it. By far the larger part of the slaves know as little of their ages as horses know of theirs, and it is the wish of most masters within my knowledge to keep their slaves thus ignorant. I do not remember to have ever met a slave who could tell of his birthday. They seldom come nearer to it than planting-time, harvesttime, cherry-time, spring-time, or fall-time. A want of information concerning my own was a source of unhappiness to me even during childhood. The white children could tell their ages. I could not tell why I ought to be deprived of the same privilege. I was not allowed to make any inquiries of my master concerning it. He deemed all such inquiries on the part of a slave improper and impertinent, and evidence of a restless spirit. The nearest estimate I can give makes me now between twenty-seven and twenty-eight years of age. I come to this, from hearing my master say, some time during 1835, I was about seventeen years old.<br />

				"Wall, chilern, whar dar is so much racket dar must be somethin' out o' kilter. I tink dat 'twixt de niggers of de Souf and de womin at de Nork, all talkin' 'bout rights, de white men will be in a fix pretty soon. But what's all dis here talkin' 'bout?<br />
<br />
"Dat man ober dar say dat womin needs to be helped into carriages, and lifted ober ditches, and to hab de best place everywhar. Nobody eber helps me into carriages, or ober mud-puddles, or gibs me any best place!" And raising herself to her full height, and her voice to a pitch like rolling thunders, she asked "And ain't I a woman? Look at me! Look at me! Look at my arm!" (and she bared her right arm to the shoulder, showing her tremendous muscular power). "I have ploughed, and planted, and gathered into barns, and no man could head me! And ain't I a woman? I could work as much and eat as much as a man—when I could get it—and bear de lash a well! And ain't I a woman? I have borne thirteen chilern, and seen 'em mos' all sold off to slavery, and when I cried out with my mother's grief, none but Jesus heard me! And ain't I a woman?<br />
<br />
"Den dey talks 'bout dis ting in de head; what dis dey call it?" ("Intellect," whispered some one near.) "Dat's it, honey. What's dat got to do wid womin's rights or nigger's rights? If my cup won't hold but a pint, and yourn holds a quart, wouldn't ye be mean not to let me have my little half-measure full?" And she pointed her significant finger, and sent a keen glance at the minister who had made the argument. The cheering was long and loud.<br />
<br />
"Den dat little man in black dar, he say women can't have as much rights as men, 'cause Christ wan't a woman! Whar did your Christ come from?" Rolling thunder couldn't have stilled that crowd, as did those deep, wonderful tones, as she stood there with outstretched arms and eyes of fire. Raising her voice still louder, she repeated, "Whar did your Christ come from? From God and a woman! Man had nothin' to do wid Him." Oh, what a rebuke that was to that little man.<br />
<br />
Turning again to another objector, she took up the defense of Mother Eve. I can not follow her through it all. It was pointed, and witty, and solemn; eliciting at almost every sentence deafening applause; and she ended by asserting: "If de fust woman God ever made was strong enough to turn de world upside down all alone, dese women togedder" (and she glanced her eye over the platform) "ought to be able to turn it back, and get it right side up again! And now dey is asking to do it, de men better let 'em." Long-continued cheering greeted this. "Bleeged to ye for hearin' on me, and now old Sojourner han't got nothin' more to say."</p>

			<p>Sojourner Truth left her mark as an activist for civil rights and women rights, but a single speech made her an icon of African American culture.</p>
			
			<p>"Ar'n't I a Woman" (sometimes titled "Ain't I a Woman?") was Truth's response to a group of ministers' theological attacks on women's rights. At a convention on the matter in Akron, Ohio, in the summer of 1851, she took the podium to denounce the stereotypes she had to endure as a black woman. Her informal and direct style conquered the crowd, and various versions of her speech were published later on.</p>
	
			<p>The version presented on the left is from the 1878 edition of the Narrative of Sojourner Truth. The language is representative of the colloquial African American Vernacular English of the era; reading the text aloud may help you understand the more difficult passages.</p>

		<h2>Based on a True Story</h2>
		
		<p>The African American slaves' pleas for freedom went unheard for decades, but as a growing number of white people from Europe and America started joining the abolitionist movement at the end of the 18th century, the interest in works by African Americans, especially autobiographies, reached an unprecedented high.</p>

			<p>In his autobiography, The Interesting Narrative of the Life of Olaudah Equiano, or Gustavus Vassa, the African, Written by Himself, Equiano writes that he was born around 1745 in the village of Essaka, in a region corresponding to today's eastern Nigeria. He explains how he was kidnapped at age 11 and brought to the New World on a slave ship in 1756 (Gates and McKay 188).</p>
			
			<p>In Virginia, Equiano was sold as a personal servant to a Royal Navy officer, Captain Michael Pascal (Equiano Project n. pag.). His name was changed to Gustavus Vassa; renaming was a common practice among slave owners. On his master's ship, Equiano was given naval training and fought alongside the British during the Seven Years War against France. At that time, Pascal sent Equiano to England to attend school and eventually allowed him to be baptized at Westminster in 1759.</p>
	
			<p>After the war was won in 1763, Equiano was denied his freedom and the prize money promised by Pascal.  Instead, he was sold to another ship captain and taken to the Carribean.</p>
	
			<p>Being well-educated and knowing how to manoeuver a ship, Equiano was too valuable to work in the plantations. He was acquired by Robert King, a Quaker merchant from Philadelphia, who gave Equiano a responsible position in his trade. King also helped Equiano improve his literacy skills and let him manage his own trade, which enabled Equiano to save up enough money to buy his freedom in 1766.</p>
			
			<p>In his early twenties, Equiano travelled and traded for several years. He even participated in a naval expedition to find a passage through the North Pole in 1773. Finally, in 1777, Equiano returned to England to settle down. He became involved in the abolitionist movement and was introduced to many important members of society who encouraged him to write his life story. His autobiography was published in 1789 and became an immediate success. Its description of the life of an African slave and immigrant was one of the earliest and most influential slave narratives. Its popularity not only furthered the anti-slavery movement in England, but also gave Olaudah Equiano economic independence.</p>
	
			<p>In 1792, Equiano married Susannah Cullen, an Englishwoman, and had two children with her before her death in 1795. Equiano died in 1797, leaving a considerable estate to his surviving daughter.</p>
	
			<p>After examining baptismal records and ship documents, some critics have suggested that Equiano may in fact have been born as a slave in South Carolina and that his accounts of African life were based on his readings and stories told by other slaves. Nevertheless, this controversy does not diminish the accuracy of Equiano's descriptions, and the contribution of his book to the anti-slavery movement and the abolition of the slave trade.</p>

			<p>Phillis Wheatley was born around 1753 in Africa, in part of present-day Senegal. At seven or eight years old, she was kidnapped and taken aboard the Phillis, the slave ship that took her to the New World (and presumably the inspiration for her new first name). She was sold in Boston to John Wheatley, a wealthy merchant looking for a maid for his wife, Susanna.</p>
			
			<p>The Wheatleys soon noticed that Phillis was a precocious child. She rapidly learned to speak and read English fluently. The family decided to relieve her from most of her maid duties and encouraged her to study the Bible, English, Latin, Greek, history, and geography, and to write poetry. In 1767, one of her first poems was published in a Rhode Island newspaper. Three years later, she became famous for an elegy on the Methodist Reverend George Whitefield. Her subsequent works were well received by readers. Encouraged by her master, John Wheatley, she began preparing a collection of her works.</p>
	
			<p>At the time, the European and American white elite did not believe a black slave could produce poetry, the highest form of literature. Phillis and her white supporters, led by John Wheatley, had to defend her authoring capabilities in court. Unable to find a publisher in Boston, they turned to their connections in London, where the book Poems on Various Subjects finally came out in 1773. Phillis toured England to promote her book, and her work was a success in both England and the United States. That same year, John Wheatley emancipated her.</p>
	
			<p>Phillis decided to stay with the Wheatleys to look after her former masters. During the American Revolution, she wrote patriotic poetry encouraging independence; in 1775, she sent a poem to George Washington, who received her in his headquarters the following year.</p>
			
			<p>After the death of John Wheatley in 1778, Phillis married John Peters, a free black grocer from Boston. During the next five years, the Peters live in poverty and their two children died in infancy. In the months preceding her death in 1784 (from complications of childbirth), Phillis Wheatley, abandoned by her husband while pregnant, published four more poems. Unfortunately, she did not have the time to find a publisher for her second book, which was left unfinished and eventually lost.</p>
	
			<p>As the first African American to publish a book and receive international acknowledgement, Phillis Wheatley is a crucial figure in African American literature.</p>

			<p>Isabella Baumfree was born a slave around 1797 in Ulster County, New York. Separated from her parents as a child, she worked for several masters who took advantage of her atypical strength and six-foot height.  Isabella had at least five children while in bondage and was able to take her youngest daughter, Sophia, with her when she escaped in 1826. She was officially freed by the New York State Emancipation Act of 1827 and moved to New York City after recovering her son Peter, illegally sold into slavery in Alabama.</p>
			
			<p>While working in New York, Isabella converted to Christianity. In 1843, convinced that God had given her a mission to spread the hope of empowerment across the country, she changed her name to Sojourner Truth and starting travelling as an itinerant preacher. Her oratory skills drew crowds wherever she appeared. In Massachussetts, she met prominent abolitionist activists like Frederick Douglass and William Lloyd Garrison, and decided to join their ranks. She became renowned for her folksy and inflammatory speeches denouncing slavery.  Her commitment to human rights made her embrace feminism as well, and she soon joined an active group of black women abolitionists.</p>
	
			<p>She also worked on several civil rights struggles during the Civil War, recruiting black troops in Michigan, helping African Americans who had escaped to the North to find shelter, and campaigning to desegregate streetcars in Washington, D.C.</p>
	
			<p>Sojourner Truth never learned to read or write, but she worked with sympathetic women on two projects to preserve her life story and her contribution to the civil rights cause. Her biography, Narrative of Sojourner Truth, was published in 1850 with the help of Olive Gilbert, and an extended version including her Book of Life (personal correspondence, newpaper clippings, tributes from her friends) was published in 1878, 1881, and 1884 with the help of Frances Titus. More than her books, it was Truth's speech on the dignity of women in 1851 (later known as "Ain't I a Woman?") that made her a major cultural figure.</p>
			
			<p>Age and ill health caused Sojourner Truth to retire from the lecture circuit at the beginning of the 1880s. She spent her last days in a sanatorium in her town of Battle Creek, Michigan, and died at home on November 26, 1883.</p>
	
			<p>Sojourner Truth's memory and legacy have been honoured numerous times over the years: induction to various Women's Halls of Fame, memorials and markers, a commemorative postage stamp. In 1997, NASA named a Mars probe after her, and in 2008, she became the first black woman honoured with a bust in the US Capitol.</p>

			<p>Frederick Augustus Washington Bailey was born a slave near Hillsboro in Maryland in February 1818. His mother was a slave, and his father an unknown white man. Frederick never knew his exact date of birth or the identity of his father (who many suspect to have been his first master, Aaron Anthony). He spent his early childhood with his grandparents and an aunt. He saw his mother only a few times before her death when he was seven years old.</p>
			
			<p>A year later, in 1826, Frederick was sent to Baltimore to serve Hugh and Sophia Auld. Sophia started teaching young Frederick how to read, but when her husband found out, he angrily put a stop to the lessons. From that moment, as an act of rebellion, Frederick taught himself how to read and write. In 1833, he was returned to his legal owner in Maryland, who sent him to a farm held by a renowned slavebreaker, Edward Covey. After months of mistreatment and humiliation, Frederick fought back and won. He was never beaten again. This event was a turning point in Frederick's history and future writings.</p>
	
			<p>In 1836, Frederick returned to Baltimore and started investing his earnings in an escape plan. He succeeded in 1838.  With the help of his future wife and false papers in hand, he took a train, pretending to be a free black sailor. He arrived a month later with his bride in the black community of New Bedford, Massachussetts, where he took on a new name: Frederick Douglass.</p>
	
			<p>Douglass joined the abolitionist movement and became a renowned speaker. Because of rumours that such an articulate man could hardly have been born a slave, Douglass wrote his first autobiography in 1845, titled Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, an American Slave, Written by Himself. The book was an international bestseller. Afraid that the information might endanger his freedom, Douglass departed on a lecture tour for England, Scotland, and Ireland. Two years later, he purchased his emancipation with the help of friends and returned to the United States. In 1847, he founded the North Star, a black-run newspaper promoting a stronger role for African Americans in the fight against slavery.</p>
			
			<p>In the 1850s, Douglass changed his earlier belief that the Constitution encouraged slavery. He came to agree that, instead, the document should be used to fight for the emancipation of African Americans. This reversal of opinion distanced Douglass from the radical branch of the abolitionist movement and made him reconsider his goals. In 1855, he published a second autobiography, My Bondage and My Freedom, in which he discussed his transition to freedom and reflected on slavery, racism, and the complexity of American society.</p>
			
			<p>During the Civil War, Douglass conferred with Abraham Lincoln and campaigned for letting blacks engage in the fight for their freedom. He actively participated in the recruitment of African Americans in the Union Army.</p>
	
			<p>After the war, Douglass was given important political positions. He also continued speaking around the country, promoting voting rights, racial equality, and women's rights. These activities allowed him and his family to live comfortably in Washington for the rest of his life.</p>
	
			<p>In 1892, Douglass published his last autobiography: Life and Times of Frederick Douglass. He died suddenly three years later, in 1895, shortly after giving a speech at a women's rights meeting.</p>

		<h2>From the British Colonies to the American Civil War</h2>
		
		<p>In the British colonies of America, slaves were not the only ones dreaming of freedom. Their owners, the white colonists, also felt abused by their homeland. The colonies finally joined forces: the United States of America declared their independence and sparked off a war with their mother country, which they finally won in 1783.</p>
		
		<p>Less than one hundred years after the end of that conflict, however, the United States began to tear each other to pieces. And one of the main issues of the dispute was . . . slavery.</p>

			<p>After the Seven Years War between Great Britain and France ended in 1763, the relationship between the thirteen British colonies in North America and their mother country deteriorated. The British goverment, in debt because of the war, wanted to impose new tax increases on its colonies.</p>
			
			<p>Because the colonies lacked representation in the British Parliament, many American colonists claimed the laws were imposed on them; they appealed for independence, rejecting the British monarchy and the government's authority. The political leaders of the revolution were inspired by English philosopher John Locke's liberal ideas that all people have equal rights and are allowed to defend them, and that revolutions are sometimes necessary if a government does not respect its citizens' rights. In this spirit, the leaders of the colonies created Provincial Congresses in order to gradually replace the British government. They finally unified the institutions in a single Congress in 1774.</p>
	
			<p>In the growing movement towards independence, African American slaves saw the occasion to plead for their own freedom. They started writing petitions, letters, and literary works in favour of the abolition of slavery; they participated in street demonstrations. Many white Americans agreed there was a contradiction between the Patriots' demands of equality and liberty, and the general acceptance of slavery. But many colonists still feared slave revolts, especially in the colonies of the South.</p>
	
			<p>When the armed conflict between the British troops and the colonial militias started in 1775, both British and American governments tried to attract the slaves to their side with promises of freedom. Despite discriminatory treatment while in the army, many African Americans fought on both sides of the conflict. Most of them battled with the Loyalists (supporters of the British crown) because the Patriots, led by George Washington, hesitated a long time before letting black men into their ranks.</p>
			
			<p>In 1776, representatives of all colonies voted in Congress and adopted the United States Declaration of Independence, advocating equality and freedom for all.  Unfortunately, this liberty did not apply to all African Americans. While slavery was gradually abolished in the colonies of the North from 1777 to 1804, the southern states did not join the movement.</p>
	
			<p>The Revolutionary War officially ended in 1783 with Great Britain's defeat and the signature of the Treaty of Paris, granting independence to the United States of America.  As a reward for their services, certain African Americans were freed, but many faced the hypocrisy of both governments and were sent back to the plantations.  While the free black population grew in the North of the newly formed country, slavery continued to spread in the South and to the West.</p>

				Excerpt of the Declaration of Independence:<br />
<br />
When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.<br />
<br />
We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness. <br />
<br />
That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness.</div>

			<p>In 1776, the thirteen American colonies and Great Britain had been at war for a year. The members of the Congress formed in 1774 by the colonists wrote petitions to the King and boycotted British goods to protest against harsh laws and Acts imposed by the British government, but without success.</p>
			
			<p>As the population became increasingly in favour of colonial independence, Congress debated the question and finally appointed a group of five men to write a Declaration of Independence: John Adams, Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson, Robert R. Livingston, and Roger Sherman.</p>
	
			<p>Jefferson drafted the document, which was then edited by the four other committee members. The Declaration was presented to Congress and, after 39 revisions, it was adopted on the fourth of July 1776.</p>
	
			<p>The Declaration defended human rights and freedom, and its affirmation that "all men are created equal" stirred up controversy because of the prevalent practice of slavery in America. Thomas Jefferson himself owned about 200 slaves when he wrote the document.</p>
			
			<p>African American slaves saw the Declaration as an opportunity to reclaim their freedom. The document became a crucial tool for the abolitionist movement, and for the next hundred years or so, abolitionists and supporters of slavery argued about whether or not black Americans should have the right to "Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness."</p>

			<p>After the federal election of 1860 in the United States of America, the leaders of many southern slave states were concerned. The newly elected President, Abraham Lincoln, was opposed to the propagation of slavery in the new Western territories. Planters from the South would not be able to exploit new cotton and sugar cane fields in the rich soils of the West if slavery was abolished. They would eventually lose their actual slaves and, in the end, their whole way of life. So after almost a decade of political tension with the increasingly powerful northern states, eleven southern states (the "Confederacy") seceded from the United States in 1861. After this act of rebellion and a first attack by Confederate soldiers, the United States government (the "Union") recruited its own army of volunteers, and the American Civil War started.</p>
			
			<p>Although the abolition of slavery was a major cause of the war, African Americans were not allowed to fight at first, even in the Union army. Abraham Lincoln did not want the few slave states that joined the Union to turn against the government. Also, in spite of their opposition to slavery, many northern abolitionists believed that black people were not entitled to the same rights as white people. African Americans protested by petitioning, writing letters, and demonstrating. They also joined the war effort by non-military means (manual labour, scouting . . . ), in dreadful conditions and often without being paid.</p>
	
			<p>Black troops were finally allowed to join the Union army in January 1863, when the Emancipation Proclamation took effect in the Union states. In total, approximately 200,000 African Americans fought for the Union. Of that number, 38,000 died, mostly because of diseases. Again, black soldiers did not benefit from the same conditions as whites. Meanwhile, an increasing number of southern slaves were attempting to cross the Union lines. All Confederate property was considered contraband, so goods were to be captured and slaves freed.</p>
	
			<p>The Confederacy began to fall in January 1865, following severe shortages of supplies and successful attacks by the Union army. Shortly after President Abraham Lincoln was assassinated (April 14, 1865), the last Confederate troops surrendered. In total, more than 620,000 soldiers were killed during the American Civil War, in addition to numerous civilian casualties, making it the deadliest war in American history.</p>
			
			<p>The Union victory ended slavery in the United States and restored the power of the federal government. African Americans were free, but their integration into American society would bring up many new challenges.</p>
