		<h2>Rebuilding a Nation–Tearing Down a Race</h2>
			
		<p>After the end of the Civil War, it quickly became apparent that not everyone shared the same enthusiasm as African Americans regarding their newly acquired freedom.</p>
		
		<p>During the Reconstruction Period, African Americans discovered that being free did not mean being treated equally.</p>

			<p>Newly freed African Americans craved education, knowing it would help them gain power and independence.  Although black schools did exist before the abolition of slavery, they were few and clandestine, as educating slaves was forbidden by law.</p>
			
			<p>After 1865, these institutions started functioning openly, and new schools were set up by literate African Americans. In the South, black communities invested a lot of their own resources in education; they were also supported by northern missionary organizations and the government's Freedmen's Bureau in recruiting teachers, renting buildings, raising funds, and protecting students and professors from violent acts by white supremacy groups. When the Bureau closed in 1870 and religious organizations started to step down, the philanthropic foundations of new industrialists such as John Rockefeller continued to invest in African American education.</p>
	
			<p>Despite these efforts, black schools were still outnumbered by white schools and suffered discrimination in the attribution of government funds.   When the right to vote was given to freedmen, black politicians started to lobby for a public education system for all in the South.</p>
	
			<p>In the last years of the Reconstruction Period, African Americans set their focus on higher education, with the birth of over 20 black colleges like Howard University and Hampton. In addition to teaching liberal arts and training teachers, they provided industrial education (printing, sewing, carpenting, farming, tailoring . . . ). This increased the independence of freedpeople by allowing them to build their own houses and schools, grow their own food, and make their own clothing and shoes.</p>
			
			<p>The ascension of black schools caused the illiteracy rate among the African American population to drop from 90% to 30% within 50 years after the Civil War. The new schools faced opposition from southern governments and whites after the end of the Reconstruction Period, but many of them went on to become the centre of the civil rights battles in the next century.</p>

			<p>A few months before the end of the Civil War, in March 1865, Congress created the Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen, and Abandoned Lands (the Freedmen's Bureau), whose role was to support former slaves and black war refugees. The Bureau provided food, medical care, and housing, managed abandoned and confiscated property, defended freedmen's rights, established schools, and helped freedmen find jobs. Many people were against this initiative, however, because they believed it favoured blacks over whites. Many politicians opposed it, and the Bureau was shut down a year after its creation.</p>
			
			<p>African Americans encountered many difficulties in their search for employment. In many states, especially in the South, Black Codes and later laws excluded former slaves from all professions except domestic help and agricultural labour. Freedmen who started businesses were discriminated against and often harassed by radical white groups like the Ku Klux Klan. African American farmers had few resources, and few could afford their own land. They had to rely on sharecropping (giving a large portion of the crops to a landowner in exchange for housing) to survive. Many former slaves' inability to read led them to sign unfair contracts. Nevertheless, renting or owning land was much more valuable to African Americans than simply earning wages.</p>
	
			<p>Acknowledging that fact, the United States government distributed thousands of acres of abandoned land to former slaves, mostly in South Carolina and Georgia. A 40-acre plot and a mule were given to each of more than 40,000 freedmen. This arrangement became known as “40 acres and a mule,” but when Andrew Johnson became President following Abraham Lincoln's assassination, the arrangement and all similar measures were cancelled.</p>
	
			<p>Now mostly working for landowners, African American farmers started to organize labour conventions around 1870, in order to gain better working conditions. To establish fair hours and wages, and to gain a voice in public policies, they created their own farm labour organizations, predecessors to the black unions that would later defy the discriminating work conditions offered by white employers.</p>
			
			<p>In the years following Reconstruction, the need for economic freedom and the exodus to urban regions motivated many African Americans to give up sharecropping and take on industrial jobs, as well as start their own businesses.</p>

			<p>The heavy social and economic consequences of the Civil War caused public resentment towards African Americans, who were seen by many as the main cause of the conflict. Also, the creation of the Freedmen's Bureau to support former slaves and black refugees from the South made many white people believe that the federal government was favouring African Americans over them.</p>
			
			<p>This anger led to various manifestations of racism. In the South, paramilitary groups promoting white supremacy were created, including the Ku Klux Klan, the Knights of the White Camellia, and the White League. The mission of these groups was to keep black people and their white allies away from political office by means ranging from intimidation to violence and terrorist acts, such as beatings, lynchings, rape, murder, arson, etc. Racist publications also came out, promoting black stereotypes and justifying racist actions. African Americans were divided on how to respond to these attitudes; reciprocal violence was an important but limited response. Other ways of coping with this resentment were found in cultural and community actions.</p>
	
			<p>Although they were free, African Americans were treated as second-class citizens and did not have the right to vote. In response to the Confederacy's defeat in the Civil War and the abolition of slavery, Black Codes were imposed in all former slave states and certain northern states. These laws limited the freedmen's civil rights and controlled their movements and activities. They encouraged segregation, relegating African Americans to separate (and lower-class) housing, schools, and jobs.  Black Codes were repealed by the Republican government in 1866, only to be replaced with other segregation laws which were considered less harsh.</p>
	
			<p>In order to gain full citizenship, African Americans formed political alliances with Republicans from the North. The Republican government finally granted voting rights to black men, but was not ready to consider equal economic rights. In the end, the Republican support for African Americans proved to be limited. In exchange for the southern white vote in the 1876 federal election, the Republican presidential candidate promised not to interfere in racial relations in the South. After the Republican victory, all federal troops were removed from the former Confederate states in 1877, an event that is considered to mark the end of the Reconstruction Period. In the following years, African Americans were subjected to more segregating laws (Jim Crow laws), but the will to defend their civil rights only became stronger.</p>

		<h2>A Wind of Optimism</h2>
		
		<p>Despite the challenges they faced during the Reconstruction Period, many African Americans were optimistic. A new musical genre, gospel, reflected their fresh joy and hope. Black writers were also becoming more ambitious. After all, who could explain African American history and culture or create literary works featuring black characters better than African Americans themselves?</p>
		
		<p> The African American community organized itself and developed quickly during this period. In response to the discrimination it suffered, various opinions arose among its leaders and showed through in many literary works of the Reconstruction Period.</p>

			<p class="citation">Mr. Ryder might aptly be called the dean of the Blue Veins. The original Blue Veins were a little society of colored persons organized in a certain Northern city shortly after the war. Its purpose was to establish and maintain correct social standards among a people whose social condition presented almost unlimited room for improvement. By accident, combined perhaps with some natural affinity, the society consisted of individuals who were, generally speaking, more white than black. Some envious outsider made the suggestion that no one was eligible for membership who was not white enough to show blue veins. The suggestion was readily adopted by those who were not of the favored few, and since that time the society, though possessing a longer and more pretentious name, had been known far and wide as the "Blue Vein Society," and its members as the "Blue Veins."<br />

			<p>At the peak of his literary career, from 1899 to 1905, Charles W. Chesnutt witnessed the regression of African American status in the South after the Reconstruction Period and the rise of prejudice, according to which blacks were incapable of assuming citizenship reponsibilities.</p>
			
			<p>In the two short story collections and three novels he published during that period, Chesnutt not only depicted the psychological effects of slavery and racism on African Americans, he also demonstrated how their strength and dignity made them entitled to the same rights as white Americans.</p>
	
			<p>Today, specialists recognize Charles W. Chesnutt as the most influential African American fiction writer of his time and the founder of the short story tradition in African American literature.</p>

			<p class="citation">I have learned that success is to be measured not so much by the position that one has reached in life as by the obstacles which he has overcome while trying to succeed. Looked at from this standpoint, I almost reached the conclusion that often the Negro boy's birth and connection with an unpopular race is an advantage, so far as real life is concerned. With few exceptions, the Negro youth must work harder and must perform his tasks even better than a white youth in order to secure recognition. But out of the hard and unusual struggle through which he is compelled to pass, he gets a strength, a confidence, that one misses whose pathway is comparatively smooth by reason of birth and race.<br />

- Booker T. Washington, Up from Slavery, 1901.</p>

			<p>Up from Slavery was Booker T. Washington's major work. It was first published in 1900–1901 as a serial in a family magazine called Outlook. With this second version of his autobiography (The Story of My Life and Works was published for the black readership the previous year), Booker T. Washington was aiming for a wide audience, especially the wealthy class who could help fund his various projects, including the Tuskegee Institute.</p>
			
			<p>The work was a success worldwide. It was acclaimed by literary critics and translated into several languages. Its self-effacing and unaffected style (compared to other slave narratives) made it very popular among white readers, who barely perceived Washington's social agenda between the lines.</p>
	
			<p>Washington wanted the white population to see that African Americans were not attached to the ball and chain. He wanted to show that they could contribute to American society. In Up From Slavery, his attempts at reconciliation and his revisionist vision of slavery and segregation (ordeals that made African Americans stronger and cleverer) divided his readers. Some saw Washington as a forward-looking leader, while others thought he was betraying the black population by encouraging it to seek economic self-sufficiency before civil and political rights.</p>
	
			<p>In addition to Up From Slavery, Booker T. Washington (with the help of ghostwriters) wrote numerous essays and magazine articles, a biography of Frederick Douglass, and a history of black America.</p>

			<p>Gospel music was created in the late 19th century, during the mass Christian revival movement in the United States. The first published use of the term “gospel” was apparently in the 1870s. In 1874, American singer, composer, and conductor P.P. Bliss edited a collection titled Gospel Songs and added a supplement called Gospel Hymns in 1875.</p>
			
			<p>In African American culture, gospel music was made popular in the black Holiness churches of the northern states. Musicians started mixing elements of spirituals, jazz, and blues in choir and solo songs, and incorporated instruments such as bass guitar, piano, drums, Hammond organ, and horns.</p>
	
			<p>At first, traditional church songs and spirituals were played in the gospel style, but soon original gospel songs were composed. Like spirituals, they praised God and Jesus and communicated religious fervour, but they also expressed the joy of freedom. Their composer was also clearly identified, and many artists, composers, and singers became gospel stars in the 1930s. The popularity of this type of music as early as the late 19th century led to the establishment of gospel music publishing houses, which used travelling quartets to publicize their music. This, combined with the advent of radio in the 1920s, greatly increased the audience for gospel.</p>
	
			<p>Over the years, while still attached to spirituals and blues, gospel has been influenced by other musical trends like hip hop and R&B. Today, it is still one of the most popular constituents of the African American oral tradition.</p>
			
			<p>Click the icon on the left to hear a gospel song: "This Little Light of Mine." This song was written around 1920 by Harry Dixon Loes. Loes was a musical composer and teacher who wrote and co-wrote several other gospel songs. "This Little Light of Mine" was first collected in 1939 by John Lomax, an African American musicologist and folklorist.</p>
			
			<p>The fact that this version differs quite significantly from the one in your Text Collection illustrates the dynamism of the oral tradition.</p>

				I was born in Tuckahoe, near Hillsborough, and about twelve miles from Easton, in Talbot county, Maryland. I have no accurate knowledge of my age, never having seen any authentic record containing it. By far the larger part of the slaves know as little of their ages as horses know of theirs, and it is the wish of most masters within my knowledge to keep their slaves thus ignorant. I do not remember to have ever met a slave who could tell of his birthday. They seldom come nearer to it than planting-time, harvesttime, cherry-time, spring-time, or fall-time. A want of information concerning my own was a source of unhappiness to me even during childhood. The white children could tell their ages. I could not tell why I ought to be deprived of the same privilege. I was not allowed to make any inquiries of my master concerning it. He deemed all such inquiries on the part of a slave improper and impertinent, and evidence of a restless spirit. The nearest estimate I can give makes me now between twenty-seven and twenty-eight years of age. I come to this, from hearing my master say, some time during 1835, I was about seventeen years old.<br />

			<p>Booker Taliaferro Washington was born a slave in 1856 in Hale's Ford, Virginia. His mother was a black slave, and his father an unknown white man. As a child, Washington worked as a house slave and accompanied his master's children to school, to carry their books. This peek at a classroom left him fascinated by education.</p>
			
			<p>When slavery was abolished in 1865, Washington's family moved to Malden, West Virginia. At nine years old, Booker T. Washington started working in salt and coal mines. He began early in the morning in order to attend school in the afternoon. At the age of 16, disappointed by the quality of schooling in his area, he obtained permission from his parents to quit work and return to Virginia to attend the Hampton Institute, an industrial school for blacks and native Americans founded after the Civil War. Washington made the trip on foot and paid his tuition and board at the institute by working as the janitor.</p>
	
			<p>Because Washington believed that education was the key to equality in his country, he became a teacher after graduation. After first teaching at the Hampton Institute,  he was recommended for a principal position at the new Tuskegee Normal and Industrial Institute in Alabama, in 1881. The need to raise funds for the institute and other educational programs led Washington to travel all over the United States. He soon became a well-known speaker for the improvement of black education.</p>
	
			<p>In 1895, Washington—who over the years had emerged as a famous educator and orator—was invited to pronounce the opening speech at the Cotton States Exposition, an unprecedented honour for an African American. His address, known as the "Atlanta Compromise," explained his major thesis, that blacks could secure their constitutional rights through their own economic and moral advancement rather than through legal and political changes. He asserted that blacks and whites could remain separate in social matters, but that in economic matters there should not be any barriers to advancement. Through hard work, African Americans would achieve self-reliance and economic success, and prove they deserved fair treatment before the law.</p>
			
			<p>Washington's autobiography Up From Slavery, published in 1901, conveyed a similar message in an attempt to reconcile blacks and whites. Education and economic self-sufficiency took precedence over civil and political rights. Social solidarity between African Americans would help them cope with segregation. Washington condemned slavery, but he believed that African Americans had gained valuable skills, confidence, and strength in their struggle with bondage.</p>
			
			<p>This point of view stirred up controversy at the time. His conciliatory stand angered many blacks, especially educated professionals, who feared it would be harmful to their demands for political and civil rights. On the other hand, it won over many southern whites (some former slaveowners), without whose financial support Washington could not have achieved his educational projects, including turning the Tuskegee Institute into a significant institution.</p>
			
			<p>Booker T. Washington's legacy as a black leader and educator is substantial. The Tuskegee Institute became the Tuskegee University, which today is one of the best colleges in the United States and enrols approximately 3,000 students of all origins. After Washington's death in 1915, it was discovered that he had secretly been involved in anti-segregationist activities, such as projects to fight lynching, disenfranchisement, and unequal facilities in education and transportation. He also challenged many state laws in court with his attorneys and financially supported blacks who could not afford legal services.</p>

		<div class="content-text-container right">
		
			<p>Charles Waddell Chesnutt was born in Cleveland, Ohio, on June 20, 1858. His parents were two free African Americans from the South, but his mixed heritage allowed him to easily pass as white. Chesnutt never denied his African American roots, although racial passing (the assimilation of a mixed-race person to the white majority) was a common phenomenon at the time.</p>
			
			<p>The Chesnutts moved back to the South, to North Carolina, where Charles grew up during the Reconstruction Period. He attended school in a Freedmen's Bureau institution, and later became a teacher and then an assistant principal. A studious young man, he learned several languages and stenography.  Tired of the restrictions on blacks in the South and hoping to enter the literary world, Chesnutt moved north with his wife in his early twenties. He settled in Cleveland, where he passed the Ohio State bar and opened a successful court reporting business. He also began to publish short stories, mostly folk tales, in various newspapers and magazines. Because Chesnutt's works were in line with the latest literary trend (realism), his African American heritage did not prevent him from being published. In fact, in 1887, he became the first African American to publish in the Atlantic Monthly, a prestigious literary and cultural magazine.</p>
	
			<p>A decade later, in 1899, Chesnutt published two collections of short stories and a biography of Frederick Douglass. His tales of slaves outwitting their masters mixed realism and fantasy, and used African American folklore and dialect to address social issues such as slavery, segregation, and prejudice. Chesnutt's works were an enormous success and allowed him to start writing full time. With these publications, Chesnutt became "the first African American writer of fiction to enlist the white-controlled publishing industry in the service of his social message" (Gates and McKay 602).</p>
	
			<p>In his writings, Chesnutt wanted to bring to light the social and psychological effects of discrimination and abuse on African Americans, and the qualities blacks developed to counter these, such as strong character and imagination.  In this way, he wished to demonstrate that African Americans deserved full citizenship. The works of Chesnutt explored all aspects of black culture in America, from fantastic folk tales to realistic fiction stories about issues such as race riots, interracial unions, and racial passing.</p>
			
			<p>Like those of his contemporaries Booker T. Washington and W.E.B. DuBois, Chesnutt's point of view on the situation of blacks in the United States stirred up debates. Writing about a wide range of African American issues including disturbing topics such as interracial unions and racial passing was seen by certain critics as exemplary literary realism, but others found it deeply shocking. Some also thought that the portrayal of the slaves in his folk tales and the use of dialect supported black stereotypes.</p>
			
			<p>The controversy surrounding Chesnutt's works contributed to the decline of his success. To provide a constant standard of living for his family, he decided to reopen his stenography business. Nevertheless, he continued publishing stories in magazines and writing books until his death in 1932, but his literary contribution was eclipsed by the writers of the Harlem Renaissance, who saw him as old-fashioned. Some of his novels were published more than 60 years after his death, after the value of his work was reassessed in the late 20th century.</p>
			
			<p>Despite  all this, Charles Chesnutt's legacy is considerable. He was the first African American writer to consider all racial issues faced by blacks in the United States and the most influential writer of fiction of his time. In addition to writing, he worked with Booker T. Washington for the political and social advancement of African Americans. He was awarded the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People's Spingarn Medal in 1928 for his work as an educator and writer.</p>

			<p>Frederick Augustus Washington Bailey was born a slave near Hillsboro in Maryland in February 1818. His mother was a slave, and his father an unknown white man. Frederick never knew his exact date of birth or the identity of his father (who many suspect to have been his first master, Aaron Anthony). He spent his early childhood with his grandparents and an aunt. He saw his mother only a few times before her death when he was seven years old.</p>
			
			<p>A year later, in 1826, Frederick was sent to Baltimore to serve Hugh and Sophia Auld. Sophia started teaching young Frederick how to read, but when her husband found out, he angrily put a stop to the lessons. From that moment, as an act of rebellion, Frederick taught himself how to read and write. In 1833, he was returned to his legal owner in Maryland, who sent him to a farm held by a renowned slavebreaker, Edward Covey. After months of mistreatment and humiliation, Frederick fought back and won. He was never beaten again. This event was a turning point in Frederick's history and future writings.</p>
	
			<p>In 1836, Frederick returned to Baltimore and started investing his earnings in an escape plan. He succeeded in 1838.  With the help of his future wife and false papers in hand, he took a train, pretending to be a free black sailor. He arrived a month later with his bride in the black community of New Bedford, Massachussetts, where he took on a new name: Frederick Douglass.</p>
	
			<p>Douglass joined the abolitionist movement and became a renowned speaker. Because of rumours that such an articulate man could hardly have been born a slave, Douglass wrote his first autobiography in 1845, titled Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, an American Slave, Written by Himself. The book was an international bestseller. Afraid that the information might endanger his freedom, Douglass departed on a lecture tour for England, Scotland, and Ireland. Two years later, he purchased his emancipation with the help of friends and returned to the United States. In 1847, he founded the North Star, a black-run newspaper promoting a stronger role for African Americans in the fight against slavery.</p>
			
			<p>In the 1850s, Douglass changed his earlier belief that the Constitution encouraged slavery. He came to agree that, instead, the document should be used to fight for the emancipation of African Americans. This reversal of opinion distanced Douglass from the radical branch of the abolitionist movement and made him reconsider his goals. In 1855, he published a second autobiography, My Bondage and My Freedom, in which he discussed his transition to freedom and reflected on slavery, racism, and the complexity of American society.</p>
			
			<p>During the Civil War, Douglass conferred with Abraham Lincoln and campaigned for letting blacks engage in the fight for their freedom. He actively participated in the recruitment of African Americans in the Union Army.</p>
	
			<p>After the war, Douglass was given important political positions. He also continued speaking around the country, promoting voting rights, racial equality, and women's rights. These activities allowed him and his family to live comfortably in Washington for the rest of his life.</p>
	
			<p>In 1892, Douglass published his last autobiography: Life and Times of Frederick Douglass. He died suddenly three years later, in 1895, shortly after giving a speech at a women's rights meeting.</p>

		<h2>A Bloody War and its Consequences</h2>
		
		<p>In which war did the United States of America lose the largest number of soldiers?</p>
		
		<p>Could it be World War I? World War II? The war in Iraq? Think again. With 620,000 soldiers killed, the American Civil War is the deadliest conflict in American history to this day. The destiny of African Americans was at the centre of the dispute; the outcome changed their lives forever. The American government finally set the slaves free, but this gesture launched a wave of racial discrimination that still haunts the United States today.</p>

			<p>After the federal election of 1860 in the United States of America, the leaders of many southern slave states were concerned. The newly elected President, Abraham Lincoln, was opposed to the propagation of slavery in the new Western territories. Planters from the South would not be able to exploit new cotton and sugar cane fields in the rich soils of the West if slavery was abolished. They would eventually lose their actual slaves and, in the end, their whole way of life. So after almost a decade of political tension with the increasingly powerful northern states, eleven southern states (the "Confederacy") seceded from the United States in 1861. After this act of rebellion and a first attack by Confederate soldiers, the United States government (the "Union") recruited its own army of volunteers, and the American Civil War started.</p>
			
			<p>Although the abolition of slavery was a major cause of the war, African Americans were not allowed to fight at first, even in the Union army. Abraham Lincoln did not want the few slave states that joined the Union to turn against the government. Also, in spite of their opposition to slavery, many northern abolitionists believed that black people were not entitled to the same rights as white people. African Americans protested by petitioning, writing letters, and demonstrating. They also joined the war effort by non-military means (manual labour, scouting . . . ), in dreadful conditions and often without being paid.</p>
	
			<p>Black troops were finally allowed to join the Union army in January 1863, when the Emancipation Proclamation took effect in the Union states. In total, approximately 200,000 African Americans fought for the Union. Of that number, 38,000 died, mostly because of diseases. Again, black soldiers did not benefit from the same conditions as whites. Meanwhile, an increasing number of southern slaves were attempting to cross the Union lines. All Confederate property was considered contraband, so goods were to be captured and slaves freed.</p>
	
			<p>The Confederacy began to fall in January 1865, following severe shortages of supplies and successful attacks by the Union army. Shortly after President Abraham Lincoln was assassinated (April 14, 1865), the last Confederate troops surrendered. In total, more than 620,000 soldiers were killed during the American Civil War, in addition to numerous civilian casualties, making it the deadliest war in American history.</p>
			
			<p>The Union victory ended slavery in the United States and restored the power of the federal government. African Americans were free, but their integration into American society would bring up many new challenges.</p>

			<p>On January 1, 1863, during the American Civil War, United States President Abraham Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation, by which he declared that all slaves in states "in rebellion against the United States shall be then, thenceforward, and forever free."</p>
			
			<p>By abolishing slavery in the Confederate states (except those controlled by the Union army), Lincoln sought to undermine their economy and cut down their labour force, much needed in war time. Indeed, as Union troops advanced in the South, thousands of Confederate slaves escaped to join the Union army.</p>
	
			<p>The Emancipation Proclamation facilitated the recruitment of African Americans as soldiers. About 200,000 African Americans (free men from the North and liberated slaves from the South) joined the Union army.  Despite the prejudices and the unfair treatment they received, many black batallions distinguished themselves in battle, and the manpower advantage played a critical part in the Union victory later on.</p>
	
			<p>The Proclamation did not free many slaves immediately.  It did not apply in Union states, and there were not enough federal troops to ensure its application in the Confederate states. It gave hope to many African Americans, however, and it set the ground for the 13th Amendment to the Constitution, which officially abolished slavery in all states in 1865.</p>

			<p>The Ku Klux Klan (KKK) is a secret organization created in the southern states after the American Civil War. The original Klan was organized during the winter of 1865–1866 in Pulaski, Tennessee, by six former Confederate generals defeated in the war. Its objective was to oppose the Republican governments of the Reconstruction Period, seen as "hostile and oppressive" ("Ku Klux Klan"). The name Ku Klux Klan comes from the Greek kuklos, meaning "circle."</p>
			
			<p>Several chapters of the KKK were founded in the southern states during the Reconstruction. Klan members believed in the inferiority of black people and fiercely opposed the attribution of equal rights to former slaves. To defend white supremacy, the Klan resorted to terrorism: wearing white robes, masks, and pointed hoods, the Klansmen intimidated white public officials, to drive them from office, and blacks in general, to prevent them from voting and exercising their newly gained citizenship. They also injured and even murdered those who would not respond to their attacks.</p>
	
			<p>After a few years, as the local KKK chapters became increasingly violent and incontrollable, the Klan was officially disbanded by its leader, Nathan B. Forrest, and the local organizations continued to act on their own. As additional amendments were added to the US Consitution to guarantee the rights of African Americans, secret organizations were declared illegal. Hundreds of Klansmen were arrested and the KKK slowly faded away.</p>
	
			<p>The Klan was relaunched in 1915 in Georgia under the name of "Invisible Empire, Knights of the Ku Klux Klan." Membership was open to native-born, white, Protestant males, 16 years of age or older; blacks, Roman Catholics, and Jews were excluded, and were increasingly made targets of defamation and persecution by the Klan. In the 1920s, the organization gained momentum and spread to many cities and states as the economic situation in the United States began to deteriorate. At the time, it was customary for the Klansmen to demonstrate in the streets and to burn crosses near the homes of those they wished to frighten.</p>
			
			<p>When the United States entered World War II against Nazi Germany in 1942, the Klan reduced its activities. It finally disbanded in 1944, because it was unable to pay its taxes to the federal government. When its leaders tried to revive it after the war, they met unfavourable public opinion and state legislations revoking their charter. The KKK then broke down into various subgroups which competed against each other and did not last long enough to worry the authorities.</p>
			
			<p>As the Civil Rights movement grew stronger in the 1950s, however, the KKK and its affiliated groups engaged in acts of racial violence (especially bombings) to oppose the integration of African Americans. When the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was passed, the Klan’s membership increased, reaching 40,000 in 1965. By the mid-1970s, several renowned KKK leaders ran for public office in the South. Although they did not win, they received a sizeable number of votes.</p>
			
			<p>Over the years, however, Klan membership decreased as the integration of the black population in the United States progressed. In the 1990s, many KKK members also started facing charges for racist and violent acts, some committed up to 30 years earlier. Today, Klan membership is evaluated at between 5,000 and 8,000.</p>
